In the excerpts from [*The Volcano Under the City*](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/729) and [*The Battle of New York*](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/731), how are the rioters described? In particular, how do these texts address the rioters\u2019 nationalities or relationship to America?\r\n2. Compare the [1863 illustration](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/724) and the [1887 illustration](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/725). How are the riots depicted? How is the militia depicted? What inferences can you make about the illustrators\u2019 perspectives on the draft riot? \r\n3. Using the excerpt from the \u201c[Report of the Committee of Merchants](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/730)\u201d and the [illustration of the burning of the Colored Orphan Asylum](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/723), describe how the riots impacted the African American community in New York City.\r\n4. The Civil War has been described as a \u201crich man\u2019s war and a poor man\u2019s fight.\u201d How does this connect to the tensions in the North over newly arrived immigrants?\r\n5. Using the items in this set as evidence, describe how Northern racism was a factor in the riots."

For or against the riot? In what ways might their description of the riot differ, depending on their perspectives on the draft? \r\n2. Ask students to discuss in what ways the draft riots mirror more modern day political protests (for example, protests against the Vietnam draft). What are some of the differences? Some of the similarities?\r\n"
