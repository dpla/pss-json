Davis is \r\nfinding his plans defeated, and Southern traitors in the loyal States are \r\ntrying to help him by making civil war at home, I say to myself\u2014 Don\u2019t\r\nunchain the Tiger! \r\n\r\nWhen I hear Working-Men talk about resisting the law, burning \r\nhouses, killing public officers, and bursting the doors wide open for every \r\nkind of crime and disorder, it seems to me they do not think of all the \r\ncost and of all the horrors, or of widows and orphans, and their scalding \r\ntears, and I say to them, \" Brothers ! in the name of God\u2014 Don't unchain \r\nthe Tiger!\" \r\n\r\nWhen I see well-dressed demagogues filling the ears of the people with \r\nlies, just as the traitors of the South have done, only to get the Working- \r\nMen aroused to deeds of crime and violence, while they themselves take \r\ngood care to keep out of the way, I wish I had the voice of a thunderer, \r\nthat I might say to them\u2014Don\u2019t unchain the Tiger! \r\n\r\nWorking-Men ! When any man asks you to break the law, and tries to \r\netir up your passions, while he skulks out of sight, you may set him down \r\nas your worst enemy. Spurn him as you would a viper. The patriotic \r\nWorking-Men of the North cannot afford to spend time in killing each \r\nother. Be wise, and above all things, \r\n\r\nDON'T UNCHAIN THE TIGER! \r\n\r\n\r\nA Democratic Workingman. \r\n\r\nNew York, July 24, 1863. ",
