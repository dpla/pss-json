      "text": "1. Using the *Puck* covers featuring \u201c[The Cleansing of New York](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1763),\u201d and \u201c[The Democratic Microbes](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1764),\u201d and additional reference materials, describe how others in the newspaper industry regarded yellow journalists. How might yellow journalism have been regarded by the American public reading this magazine? What point(s) were the cartoonists making with these illustrations? In what ways do the cartoons employ accurate information and in what ways do they distort \u201cfacts\u201d to make their point(s)? Do you think the *Puck* cartoonists\u2019 critiques of yellow journalism would apply to today\u2019s news media industry? Why or why not?\r\n2. Using the sheet music for \u201c[The Dugan Kid Who Lives in Hogan\u2019s Alley](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1768),\" and \"[The Yellow Kid](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1769)\" leaflet, describe how \u201cThe Yellow Kid\u201d became a symbol for yellow journalism. \r\n3. Using the [illustration of the *USS Maine*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1766), the [photograph of the wreck of the *USS Maine*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1767), the political cartoon \"[Pesky, but Harmless](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1773),\" and additional resources, consider how yellow journalism influenced the start of the Spanish-American War. Why is yellow journalism often cited as the cause of the Spanish-American War? \r\n4. What issue does the political cartoon \u201c[Still Barking](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1765)\" address? Why was yellow journalism depicted as a violent barking dog? Do you think the dog is an appropriate symbol? What symbols or elements could be used in a political cartoon to represent the contemporary news media landscape?\r\n5. What issue does the political cartoon \"[Pesky, but Harmless](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1773),\" address? Why did the cartoonist use gnats to represent jingos? The cartoon shows \u201cyellow journalism,\u201d \u201cjingo sheet,\u201d and \u201cwar shriek\u201d cast aside in the waste paper basket. What does that suggest about President McKinley\u2019s hesitancy about waging war in Cuba?\r\n6. Examine the cover art in \"[The Yellow Kid](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1769)\" leaflet along with the \u201cNote to the Reader\u201d on page 2. How do the cartoonist and the author convey the perspective of the publication? What message does this leaflet communicate to readers? Why did journalists use satire to depict societal angst and serious issues?"

      "text": "1. Ask students to conduct a classroom debate about whether yellow journalism should be illegal. Students should use the sources in this set, as well as additional evidence to support their claim. Students should consider questions such as how yellow journalism and fake news threaten freedom of the press and whether limiting free press threatens democracy in America when constructing their arguments. \r\n2. Ask students to design a political cartoon or write a news article depicting a past or current event using the characteristics of yellow journalism including sensationalism, embellishment, and hyperbole. \r\n"
