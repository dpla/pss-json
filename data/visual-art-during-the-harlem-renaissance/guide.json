Harlem Renaissance artists found inspiration in the culture and history of Egypt, the various nations of Africa, and the Caribbean. Did you see evidence of this in any of the pieces showcased here? In what way?\r\n\r\n3. Often, the visual art of the Harlem Renaissance conveyed subtle or overt criticism of the \u201cstatus quo\u201d of racial and economic inequity in the US. Did any of the pieces showcased here exemplify this? How so?\r\n\r\n4. How were Harlem Renaissance artists inspired by other artistic movements and popular artists of the era (e.g., Cubism, Picasso)? How did they adhere to these various aesthetics, and how did they depart from them?\r\n\r\n5. How does [Archibald Motley\u2019s interview](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/347) challenge our assumptions about the Harlem Renaissance? \r\n"
