  "text": "*The Crisis* magazine was established by W.E.B. DuBois in 1910 as the official magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). These lynching announcements from southern newspapers were reprinted in *The Crisis* accompanying a column headed \u201cCrime\u201d listing a number of recent lynchings in the South. The reproduced headlines from New Orleans and Jackson refer to a man named John Hartfield, who was hanged, shot, and burned to death on June 26, 1919 for allegedly having a relationship with a white woman. \r\n\r\nTranscript:\r\n\r\nThe Crisis<br>\r\n(Reprinted from the *NEW ORLEANS STATES*)\r\n\r\n3,000 WILL BURN NEGRO<br>\r\nKaiser Under Stronger Guard Following Escape of Crown Prince<br>\r\nFrank Simonds Writes for Tates<br>\r\n*NEW ORLEANS STATES*<br>\r\nVOL 39 NO 177\tNew Orleans, La. \tThursday, June 26, 1919\r\n\r\n(Reprinted from the *JACKSON DAILY NEWS*)<br>\r\nJOHN HARTFIELD WILL BE<br>\r\nLYNCHED BY ELLISVILLE MOB<br>\r\nAT 5 O\u2019CLOCK THIS AFTERNOON<br>\r\nGovernor Bilbo Says He Is Powerless to Prevent It -- Thousands of People Are Flocking Into Ellisville to Attend the Event -- Sheriff and Authorities Are Powerless to Prevent It.\r\n\r\nHattiesburg, June 26. -- John Hartfield, the negro alleged to have assaulted an Ellisville, young woman, has been taken to Ellisville and is guarded by officers in the office of Dr. Carter in that city.  He is wounded in the shoulder but not seriously.  The officers have agreed to turn him over to the people of the city at 4 o\u2019clock this afternoon when it is expected he will be burned.  The negro is said to have made a partial confession.\r\n\r\nGov. Bilbo Says<br>\r\nHe is Powerless.<br>\r\nWhen Gov. Bilbo was shown the above dispatch and asked what action if any, he intended to take to prevent the affair, he said:<br>\r\n\u201cI am powerless to prevent it.  We have guns for state militia but no men.  It is impossible to send troops to the scene for the obvious reason that we have no troops.\r\n\u201cSeveral days ago anticipating\u2026 [missing]\r\n\r\n...for the lynching has now been fixed for five p.m.<br>\r\nA committee of Ellisville citizens has been appointed to make the necessary arrangements for the event, and the mob is pledged to act in conformity with these arrangements.<br>\r\nRev. L.G. Bates, pastor of the First Baptist church of Laurel, left here at one o\u2019clock for Ellisville to entreat the mob to use discretion.",
