Using the [syringe and vial](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/949), the [news film about distribution of a polio vaccine](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/950), and the [news film about Dr. Albert Sabin](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/952), explain how Dr. Salk\u2019s and Dr. Sabin\u2019s responses to polio compare to doctors currently fighting Ebola, HIV, AIDS, or Zikka Virus.\r\n2. Using the [syringe and vial](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/949), the [news film about distribution of a polio vaccine](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/950), and the [news film about Dr. Albert Sabin](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/952), assess the importance of the Salk and Sabin vaccines. \r\n3. In the [photograph of a child in an iron lung](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/954), both the nurse and the child are models. The child did not have polio. Why do you think this photograph was taken with models and not an actual patient using the iron lung?\r\n4. Consider the [photograph of patients with a giant card](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/946) and the [photograph of patients watching President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s funeral procession](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/947). Using these photographs and what you have learned from additional sources, assess whether President Roosevelt\u2019s personal experiences with polio influenced the race to find a vaccine. \r\n"

Using the [photograph of a man with a sign](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/955) for inspiration, divide students into several groups and ask them to develop a 1940s radio or print advertisement for the foundation to raise money and awareness of polio. Have each group present to the class. \r\n"
