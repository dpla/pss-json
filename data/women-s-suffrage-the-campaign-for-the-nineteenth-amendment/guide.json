Examine the [postcard of nurses](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/363) and the [photo of a suffragette appealing to striking workers](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/364). Why do you think the suffrage movement aligned itself with professionals in fields like teaching, nursing, and other striking labor groups? What common causes did these different groups of people share? \r\n\r\n2. Compare and contrast the [anti-suffrage lithograph illustration](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/356), the [1914 poster for the International Woman Suffrage Alliance](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/358), and the [flyer listing reasons for a constitutional amendment](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/359). How does each address women\u2019s roles in the family? \r\n\r\n3. Using the items in this collection, explain the specific arguments made by those who advocated for women\u2019s suffrage and those who opposed it.\r\n\r\n4. Many of the items in this set are postcards. Why was the postcard such a popular method of communication for both suffragists and anti-suffragists? What are its advantages? With the [1915 postcard of Kewpie dolls](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/361), which strategies was the National Woman\u2019s Party using to appeal to readers?\r\n"

Design a pro-suffrage postcard that uses symbols and illustrations to encourage readers to join this side of the debate. For a more modern twist, craft a pro-suffrage argument in the form of a 140-character tweet. "
