Most of them were crowded in cars and pickups, but almost fifty of them were leading the group on foot. They began their 'longest walk' in February from the West coast and intend to arrive in the capital by July 9. They hope this march will draw public attention to a number of pending bills which they believe will undermine their culture.\u201d The Longest Walk was one of the last events formally staged by the American Indian Movement. It was intended to symbolize the historical displacement of Native Americans from their homelands and to protest contemporary conditions in Native American communities.\r\n",
