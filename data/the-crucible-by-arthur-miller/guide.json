Knowing that Arthur Miller blended historical figures to create his characters for *The Crucible*, explain the similarities between the play and the transcripts of these two historical figures. Find textual evidence from the play to support your answer.\r\n2. How is public interest in the HUAC hearings, as shown in photographs of people attending the hearings, similar to public interest in the Salem trials as depicted in *The Crucible*? Find textual evidence from the play to support your answer.\r\n3. Read [Jackie Robinson\u2019s testimony](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/644). Explain how the motives behind naming minority groups as communists are similar to the motives behind naming outcasts of Salem Village as witches in *The Crucible*.\r\n4. After watching the [film footage of Senator McCarthy at Fort Monmouth](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/639), make a list of all similarities between the communist search of the 1950s and the Salem witch hunt. In three to four sentences, discuss Miller\u2019s purpose in using the Salem Witch Trials to express his views on McCarthyism.\r\n"
