Compare and contrast the [South Central Los Angeles mural](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/454) and the [Leutze painting](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/457). \r\n3. How do the memories and experiences of [Mr. Longclaws](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/455) represent some of the negative consequences of manifest destiny?\r\n4. Are there stereotypes of Mexicans or Mexican-Americans represented in the [mannequin figure](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/462)?\r\n5. What were some of the accomplishments of Jane Cazneau, as seen in the [excerpt from her biography](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/459)? How did those accomplishments reflect manifest destiny?\r\n6. How are Native Americans depicted in the [excerpt from *Esther*](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/460)? In what ways does that depiction represent some of the ideals of manifest destiny?\r\n7. Using the [letter from A.D. Covin](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/461) and the [photograph of the Salt Lake City monument](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/463), discuss how ideas of manifest destiny can represent the whitewashing of history."

Ask students to create a new map of the US representing the diverse immigrant groups of the country. Ask students to review the thirty-seven maps on the following website ([http://www.vox.com/2015/1/12/7474897/immigration-america-maps](http://www.vox.com/2015/1/12/7474897/immigration-america-maps)) and use one of the maps to serve as a model for a new map representing the diverse immigrant groups of the US. Ask students to consider how immigration patterns have changed since the heyday of manifest destiny."
