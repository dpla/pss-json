Using the [KKK flag](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1733), the [KKK whip](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1734), and the [KKK uniform](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1746), analyze the symbols and accessories developed by the KKK. What mood do they create? What similarities and difference do you notice between the objects from the First Klan and the object from the Second Klan? \r\n2. How did the Ku Klux Klan spread their message? According to the [flyer explaining the purpose of the Ku Klux Klan](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1735) and the [mailer asking the reader to buy only American goods](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1747), what values did they want to \u201cprotect\u201d? \r\n3. The Ku Klux Klan is a domestic terrorist organization. Which information in the sources supports this claim? Examine the [KKK whip](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1734), the [excerpt from *Ku Klux Klan Secrets Exposed*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1742), the [KKK uniform](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1746), and the [press release from the NAACP](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1745), in particular.\r\n4. Compare the [photograph of a KKK initiation ceremony](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1743) and the [photograph of a KKK rally in Indiana](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1744). Who attended KKK rallies? Who is being initiated in the KKK ceremony? What do these sources reveal about who the Ku Klux Klan wanted to recruit? \r\n5. In the [essay discussing the reception of *The Birth of a Nation*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1741), Alyse Abrams explains reactions to the film on its opening night in 1915. What was the anticipated response and why? What actually happened and what does this reveal about white supremacist ideology during this era? \r\n6. How do the images in the [souvenir program](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1739) reflect ideas about the \u201cpurity\u201d of white womanhood and the Klan\u2019s beliefs about the Civil War that are also perpetuated in the film?\r\n"

Ask students to use this set\u2019s examples of KKK propaganda, the [flyer](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1735) and the [mailer](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1747), along with other sources to create a concept map outlining the main and supporting ideas of the Second Klan\u2019s ideology. Once they have finished concept maps, ask each student to find one recent news story about KKK activity (like this [2017 news story from Waynesboro, Virginia](http://www.whsv.com/content/news/KKK-recruitment-fliers-placed-on-vehicles-in-the-area-457842093.html)). Using the concept maps for reference, discuss as a whole group how the contemporary KKK uses familiar and new strategies to spread their ideology compared to previous versions of the organization.\r\n2. Show clips from the film *The Birth of a Nation* and ask students to review the [souvenir program](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1739), the [movie poster](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1740), and the [essay](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1741) about the film. Have a class discussion about how the film characterizes both African Americans and members of the Ku Klux Klan. Then ask students to write an individual letter to the local newspaper editor detailing and reacting to these portrayals from the film and its promotional materials and addressing the potential impacts on viewers.\r\n3. Using the [flyer explaining the purpose of the Ku Klux Klan](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1735) and additional research, ask students to consider the KKK\u2019s stance on immigration alongside that of earlier nativist leaders and groups from the nineteenth century. Working individually, students should select one of the following and do research to identify a time period, immigration stance, and sphere of influence: The Know Nothing (or American) Party, The American Protective Association, Denis Kearney, or The Immigration Restriction League. After outside research, each student should write a short essay that makes an argument in response to this question: How did the immigration views of the Second Ku Klux Klan build on or diverge from the views of this leader/group? \r\n4. Ask students to listen to this [talk by Reverend Delmar Dennis](http://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_28-n00zp3wb83) of Meridian, Mississippi, given July 30, 1968, regarding his infiltration of the Ku Klux Klan. Dennis was undercover as a member of the Third Klan in 1960s Mississippi to learn about the murders of civil rights workers James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner by KKK members. After listening to the talk, ask students to work in small groups or as a whole class to generate a list of KKK motivations, strategies, and routines that they learned from the talk and make connections to the sources in this set.\r\n"
