      "text": "1. Examine the [daguerreotype of John Brown](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1718). Why is Brown\u2019s hand raised in the photograph? What might the flag in the picture represent? Read the [excerpt from John Brown\u2019s address](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1722) to the court and explain how John Brown defends his actions during the raid on Harper\u2019s Ferry. Do the [daguerreotype of John Brown](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1718) and the [illustration of the swivel gun and pike](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1719) support or oppose Brown\u2019s defense of his actions? Why?\r\n2. Examine the [print of the engine house occupied by John Brown and his raiders](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1720). What kind of activity is taking place outside of the engine house? Examine the [print depicting Brown\u2019s raiders and hostages in the interior of the engine house](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1721). Which men are the hostages and which men are the raiders? What ideas were the artists of each image trying to convey to the audience? Based on these images, did the artist of each sketch approve or disapprove of Brown\u2019s raid? \r\n3. Examine the [print showing an encounter between raiders and the militia at the railroad bridge](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1723) and explain how an antislavery American and a proslavery American might have interpreted this image differently. \r\n4. Read the [excerpt from George B. Cheever\u2019s sermon](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1726). How does Cheever describe John Brown as a person? How does Cheever connect Brown\u2019s actions to his Christian duty? According to Cheever, what is the \u201cgreat lesson of this tragedy?\u201d According to the [excerpt from Edward Everett\u2019s speech](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1725), would he agree with Rev. Cheever? Why or why not?\r\n5. What is the main idea of the \u201cDirge\u201d printed on the [program for the commemorative town hall meeting](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1724)? According to their [speeches delivered in the US Senate](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1727) eleven days later, would Senators Clement Clay and William Gwin agree or disagree with this portrayal? How did Clay and Gwin think that Brown\u2019s raid would affect national politics?\r\n6. Read the lyrics of the songs entitled \u201c[John Brown\u2019s Body](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1728)\u201d and \u201c[Old John Brown: A Song for Every Southern Man](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1729).\u201d What was the purpose of each of these songs? Who were the intended audiences for each? Can you think of any other songs written in response to newsworthy events such as John Brown\u2019s raid?\r\n7. Examine the [photograph of John Brown\u2019s tombstone](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1730), the [buttons from the clothing of John Brown\u2019s raiders](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1731), and the photograph of \u201c[John Brown\u2019s Fort](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1732).\" What do you notice about John Brown\u2019s grave? Why are there three names on the tombstone? Why do you think the three buttons are now artifacts in a museum? Who might have renamed the Engine Room \u201cJohn Brown\u2019s Fort\u201d? What does each of these sources suggest about John Brown\u2019s legacy?\r\n8. Based on the [speeches delivered in the US Senate](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1727) and \u201c[Old John Brown: A Song for Every Southern Man](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1729),\u201d describe the significance of John Brown\u2019s raid for white southerners."

      "text": "1. Ask students to select a nineteenth-century abolitionist and write a letter about John Brown\u2019s raid to the editor of an antislavery newspaper such as *The Liberator* or *Frederick Douglass\u2019 Paper* from that person\u2019s perspective. Choices of abolitionists might include, but are not limited to, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Henry Highland Garnet, William Lloyd Garrison, Henry Ward Beecher, or Lucretia Mott. Students might use the [excerpt from John Brown\u2019s address](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1722), the [program for the commemorative town hall meeting](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1724), the [excerpt from George B. Cheever\u2019s sermon](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1726), and the [excerpt from Edward Everett\u2019s speech](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1725) to inform their letters, but may also conduct outside research about the abolitionist of their choosing to see how they responded to John Brown\u2019s raid.\r\n2. Based on their analysis of the [print of the engine house occupied by John Brown and his raiders](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1720),  the [print depicting Brown\u2019s raiders and hostages in the interior of the engine house](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1721), and the [print of an encounter between raiders and the militia at the railroad bridge](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1723), ask students to consider how images in newspapers might have shaped Americans\u2019 reactions to Brown\u2019s raid. Ask students to gather examples of documentary photographs about a topic in the news today to share with the class and discuss how the American public consumes news through images. Finally, have students take a photograph that captures an issue or current event in their community and write a caption for it. Students will present their photographs to the class and explain what they think it conveys. "
