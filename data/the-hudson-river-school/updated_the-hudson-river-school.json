Specifically consider America\u2019s westward expansion and manifest destiny, as well as romanticism in American literature. \r\n3. Examine [Thomas Cole\u2019s landscape painting](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/the-hudson-river-school/sources/690). How does this piece explore the Hudson River school\u2019s trademark idea of the pastoral?\r\n4. Explore the many landscape pieces in this set. What does the landscape represent? How does its meaning change between paintings?\r\n5. Using the [2009 poster](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/the-hudson-river-school/sources/704) as a jumping off point, discuss how the Hudson River school impacted Americans\u2019 relationships to land and nature.

         "text": "The Hudson River school was an artistic movement that often held up a romantic vision that humanity and nature can exist together peacefully. The American landscape\u2014and its grandiosity\u2014is the school\u2019s predominant subject. Visions of the Hudson Valley, as well as naturalistic scenes from across the United States and beyond, are depicted in the paintings. Thomas Cole is widely considered the founder of the movement; Homer Dodge Martin, Frederick Edwin Church, and Albert Bierstadt are some of the most notable first- and second-generation Hudson River school painters. While the Hudson River school artists were American, many European artists picked up the themes of their work. Few women were part of the movement, although some, like Eliza Pratt Greatorex, were influenced by it. One offshoot of the Hudson River school was the Luminism movement, and many second-generation artists\u2019 works are examples of both. "
