The Hudson River school artists lived and worked in the first half of the nineteenth century. What connections do you see between the concerns of their art and other ideas of the moment? Specifically consider America\u2019s westward expansion and manifest destiny, as well as romanticism in American literature. \r\n3. Examine [Thomas Cole\u2019s landscape painting](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/690). How does this piece explore the Hudson River school\u2019s trademark idea of the pastoral?\r\n4. Explore the many landscape pieces in this set. What does the landscape represent? How does its meaning change between paintings?\r\n5. Using the [2009 poster](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/704) as a jumping off point, discuss how the Hudson River school impacted Americans\u2019 relationships to land and nature. "
