Explore the [\u201clong hair\u201d letter](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1748) and the [response to the \u201clong hair\u201d letter](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1749). In what ways were white people biased against Indian people in the early twentieth century? Do you notice any difference in the way the Superintendent and the Commissioner think about Indian people? \r\n2. Analyze the [excerpt from *The Problem of Indian Administration*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1755), the [poster about trachoma](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1756), and the [map of reservations](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1757). What were the consequences of the reservation system and white racial bias for Indian communities?\r\n3. How did Indian people manage the pressure to assimilate alongside a commitment to their traditional ways of life? Pay particular attention to the [excerpt from *Rebuilding Indian Country*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1759), the [photograph of Superintendent Hutton and Navajo men](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1760), and the [photograph of a Navajo boy](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1761), looking closely at body language.\r\n4. Analyze the [excerpt from a daily schedule at Fort Bidwell Boarding School](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1752), the [photograph of girls at St. Francis Mission School](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1753), and the [photograph of boys and girls at St. Bernard\u2019s Mission](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1754). What would it have been like to go to schools like these? How would you change the programming at the schools if you were in charge?\r\n5. The [photograph of a Crow Indian family in their kitchen](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1750) and the [photograph of a Crow Indian camp](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1751) show two different Crow families at home. What are the similarities and differences between how they lived? How might you interpret their lifestyle choices given the other sources in this set?\r\n6. [*Rebuilding Indian Country*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1759) was produced by the federal Department of the Interior. How does that shape the images you see? Can you find evidence in the film of American Indian resistance to white ideas about how they should live?"

Have them compare their solutions to those in the [excerpt from *The New Day for the Indians*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1758), assess whether they match, and explain why or why not.\r\n"
