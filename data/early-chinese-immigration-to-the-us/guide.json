Look at the [deposition of a \u201cnon-Chinese witness\u201d](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/88) and the [application of a \u201clawfully domiciled\u201d Chinese merchant](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/89), teacher or student. Why are questions about labor such a big part of the immigration process for Chinese immigrants? How does this relate to the Chinese Exclusion Act?\r\n\r\n2. Compare and contrast the three political cartoons from [1870](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/86), [1871](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/87), and [1882](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/85). How are America and its politicians depicted? How are Chinese immigrants depicted? What does each cartoon say about the issue of Chinese immigration? What is each cartoon trying to make the reader to feel and how does the artist work to create that feeling? \r\n\r\n3. Use the items in this set as evidence to explain the kinds of discrimination Chinese immigrants faced in the United States during this period. \r\n"
