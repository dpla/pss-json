      "text": "1. Using the [map of California\u2019s gold regions](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1903), the [print depicting the line of people waiting to depart](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1904), and [George Keller\u2019s account](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1905) of how he decided to leave for California, what can you infer about the ways that Gold Rush \u201cfever\u201d spread in other parts of the country?\r\n2. Based on [Newton Chandler\u2019s letter to his wife](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1906), what can you infer about what he may have been feeling upon arriving in San Francisco? \r\n3. Do a close reading of the [photograph featuring African American workers](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1909) and the [photograph featuring Chinese workers](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1910). In each, do you think they are participating in the mining venture on equal terms with the white prospectors? Why or why not?\r\n4. Use the [map of California\u2019s gold regions](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1903) to identify Native American groups of northern California at the outset of the Gold Rush. Considering the [print depicting the roadside scene](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1914) as well, what can you infer about how the Gold Rush impacted Native Americans and their land? \r\n5. What does the [print depicting the roadside scene](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1914) suggest about the population dynamics between the different groups pictured? What people or groups pictured do you perceive are coming? Who do you perceive are going? \r\n6. Using the photographs, [Thornton McElroy\u2019s letter](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1911), and [Augustin Hibbard\u2019s letter](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1912), how would you characterize the experience of living and working in California\u2019s gold mining camps? Consider factors such as living conditions, the work of gold mining, the natural environment, and interactions with other people. Compare and contrast the view of the mining experience offered in the [painting of miners around a campfire](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1907) with the details from the photos and letters.\r\n7. Based on the [print of the town of Columbia](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1915), how might life in a town like this one be similar or different to life in the mining camps? \r\n8. Both [Augustin Hibbard\u2019s letter](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1912) and [Thornton McElroy\u2019s letter](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1911) describe successfully finding gold. Based on their letters, how do you think each of them felt about these findings? Had they \u201chit it rich\u201d?\r\n9. Do a close reading of the [print depicting the ship leaving California](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1917). Does this print advertise the Gold Rush as a boundless opportunity to find fortune or as a cautionary tale? Use evidence from the print to support your argument. \r\n10. Based on the [excerpt from *Eldorado*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1916), what does the author think made Gold Rush society unique compared to other parts of the US? "

      "text": "This set includes letters written by gold-seekers home to members of their families, but all are by people from a similar demographic\u2014 white, male fortune seekers. In this activity, students will diversify this record and explore the Gold Rush from other people\u2019s perspectives. Divide students into small groups and ask each group of students to do further research about another group of people who participated in or were impacted by the Gold Rush. Assigned groups might include African Americans, Chinese immigrants, women, Native Americans, and Latin American gold-seekers. Using their research and inspired by the \u201c[Gold is No Chimera!](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1904)\u201d print and the [print depicting the ship leaving California](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1917), ask students in each group to work together to create an image or political cartoon about the Gold Rush from the perspective of their assigned group. Post the images or posters around the room and use them to spark a discussion about how each different group experienced the Gold Rush and how people from disparate backgrounds may have interacted with each other."
