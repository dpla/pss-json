      "text": "1. Using the [collection of minstrel shows excerpted from *The Darkey Drama*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1427), the [poster advertising Neil O'Brien and the Great American Super-Minstrels](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1423), and the [audio recording of The Peerless Minstrels](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1430), describe some of the ways African Americans were represented in blackface minstrel shows. What stereotypes do you see in these performances?\r\n2. One of Du Bois\u2019s most famous quotations about the experience of African Americans in the United States, from his book *The Souls of Black Folk*, states, \u201cOne ever feels his two-ness,\u2014an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.\u201d Review the [photograph of Bert Williams](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1431), the [publicity portrait of Bert Williams](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1432), and the [draft eulogy written by W. E. B. Du Bois](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1436). Analyze the relationship between the images and Du Bois\u2019s quotation from *The Souls of Black Folk*. Which image represents what it meant to be an \u201cAmerican\u201d during that era? Which one represents what it meant to be a \u201cNegro\u201d during that era? How do the images reflect the \u201ctwo warring ideals\u201d Du Bois speaks of? How does the eulogy comment on the double consciousness Williams dealt with? \r\n3. Read pages 7-10 of the [excerpt from Thomas Nelson Page\u2019s *The Negro: A Southerner\u2019s Problem*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1422). What does this text reveal about the tension between white Northerners and white Southerners after the Civil War? Why does Page believe that the white Southerners understood African Americans best? According to Page, why do Northerners not trust Southerners? What do you think about the argument Page makes regarding \u201crespectable\u201d African Americans and those who are not \u201crespectable\u201d? \r\n4. How does the cover of the [sheet music](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1434) for \u201cMiss Brown's Cake Walk\u201d subvert common perceptions of blackness perpetuated in blackface minstrel shows? \r\n5. In the [excerpt from *The Complete Minstrel Guide*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1426), William Courtright states on page 3, \"I therefore know the weight of every line and its effect.\u201d What does Courtright mean? How can this statement also apply to the impact his work had on race relations in the United States?"

      "text": "1. Ask students to use the [collection of minstrel shows excerpted from *The Darkey Drama*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1427), the [sheet music](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1428) of \u201cOh Susanna,\u201d the [audio recording of The Peerless Minstrels](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1430), and the [sheet music](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1434) for \u201cMiss Brown's Cake Walk\u201d to identify the key elements of minstrel shows, including mood or tone, topics addressed, personalities of characters, and common settings. After students have identified the key elements, ask them to discuss how the mood and tone of the minstrel shows conflict with the mood of the United States with regard to race relations during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. \r\n2. Spike Lee\u2019s film *Bamboozled* addresses black racial identity in the year 2000 through the metaphor of blackface minstrelsy. Ask students to analyze the documents in this primary source set in relation to the film. Using the [photograph of Bert Williams](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1431), the [publicity portrait of Bert Williams](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1432), the [recording](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1433) of \u201cNobody Abyssinia,\u201d the [sheet music](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1434) for \u201cMiss Brown's Cake Walk\u201d, and the [draft eulogy written by W. E. B. Du Bois](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1436), students can compare and contrast the experience of Bert Williams and the experiences of two characters in Spike Lee\u2019s film, \u201cMantan\u201d and \u201cSleep\u2019n Eat.\u201d\r\n3. Ask students to practice visual literacy by analyzing the [photograph of Bert Williams](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1431) and the [publicity portrait of Bert Williams](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1432). Students should describe his body language in both images. What message does it convey and how does it set the mood of each image? Students should then analyze Bert Williams\u2019s gaze in each image. Finally, ask students to compare and contrast similar elements\u2014the cigarette and the shadow. How do body language, gaze, and other aspects of the pictures affect the way the viewer interprets/understands each image? \r\n4. Use sources from this set to complement a lesson on the development of African American music. The abolitionist Frederick Douglass wrote that slave songs \u201ctold a tale of woe which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension; they were tones loud, long, and deep; they breathed the prayer and complaint of souls boiling over with bitterest anguish. Every tone was a testimony against slavery.\u201d The same \u201cwoe\u201d and \u201canguish\u201d evident in slave songs marks other African American genres like the blues. Ask students to analyze the [recording](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1433) of \u201cNobody Abyssinia,\u201d alongside Langston Hughes\u2019s poem \u201cThe Weary Blues,\u201d and to identify the ways in which these resources align with what Douglass says about slave songs. How did these artists use their work as a coping mechanism, a tool for advocacy, and/or an expression of their cultural experiences? A follow-up activity may ask students to reflect on the role of music in their lives and how it may serve similar purposes. \r\n"
