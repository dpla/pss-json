  "text": "Transcript:\r\n\r\n**James Baldwin:\r\nRags To Riches**<br> \r\nHe didn't have much time to play\r\nwith other children. He was the\r\noldest of nine children and had\r\nto take care of the younger ones.\r\nJames Baldwin says, \"As they were\r\nborn, I took them over with one\r\nhand and held a book with the\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\nHe didn't have nice clothes like\r\nsome of the other boys. His father\r\nwas only a poor minister. He\r\nwasn't good looking. As a matter\r\nof fact he was quite homely, with\r\nvery large eyes. They called him\r\n\"frog eyes\"!\r\n\r\nJames Baldwin had a very special talent. He could make up the\r\nbest stories you ever heard. He\r\nwrote poems, songs, plays and stories. He amazed his teachers with\r\nhis wonderful stories. When he was\r\nabout ten years old he wrote a\r\nplay. One of his teachers took an\r\ninterest in him. She game him\r\nbooks to read and took him to the\r\ntheatre. This encouraged him to\r\nwrite and write and write.\r\n\r\nThe teachers asked him to read\r\nhis stories to the class. The children looked at him. They listened\r\nto him. They admired him. They\r\nshook their heads and said, \"No one\r\ncan write like James\"! He was the\r\nbest writer in the school. He was\r\nthe best writer around. Mayor La\r\nGuardia, the mayor of New York\r\nCity, sent him an award for a\r\nsong he'd written. He was thrilled.\r\nHis writing delighted his mother,\r\nbut his father couldn't understand\r\na son who liked to write better\r\nthan anything else. His father\r\nwanted him to be a minister. When\r\nhe was fourteen he became a preacher, but he stopped preaching\r\nwhen he reached seventeen. One\r\nday his father asked, \"You'd rather write than preach?\" James\r\nanswered, \"Yes.\" This saddened his\r\nfather very much. Sometimes parents don't understand how their\r\nchildren feel.\r\n\r\nJames was determined to become\r\na good writer; a famous writer.\r\nHe wrote about what happened to\r\nhim. He wrote about what people\r\ndid to him and how he felt about\r\nwhat they did to him. He wrote\r\nabout what he heard, saw, smelled,\r\ntasted and felt! He wrote and he\r\nwrote. He wrote and he wrote some\r\nmore. His stories got better and\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nHis father died a bitter, unhappy man. His bitterness was the\r\nresult of conditions under which he\r\nwas forced to live because he was\r\na Negro. His unhappiness killed\r\nhim before his time, before he could\r\nenjoy the fame and success of his\r\nson. Although they never understood each other, James missed\r\nhis father after he was gone.\r\nJames wondered, \"why don't they\r\nwant us? What have we done to\r\nthem?\" These thoughts hurt him\r\ndeeply. His writing gave him a\r\nchance to \"get it off his chest.\"\r\nHe began to have certain feelings\r\nabout himself and about \"those\r\npeople\" who kept him in the slums,\r\nliving a life of misery and want.\r\nThere were many bad people in\r\nthe world! Thank God there were\r\nalso many good people in the\r\nworld. One of his kind and generous white teachers helped his\r\nfamily when his father had lost\r\nhis job. There was hope for his\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nHe wrote his way through elementary school, junior high school\r\nand high school. He became editor\r\nof his high, school newspapers. More\r\nand more people began to notice\r\nhis amazing talent. He gained ad\r\nmiration and respect, James was\r\nsmall in stature, but he began to\r\nlook very big in the eyes of his\r\nadmires. Today he's such an outstanding writer you could call him\r\na giant.\r\n\r\nAfter he graduated from high\r\nSchool in 1942, he worked hard to\r\nhelp his family. He got a job in a\r\ndefense plant in New Jersey. World\r\nWar II was going on and many\r\nbusinesses were hiring Negroes for\r\nthe first time. Most of the young\r\nmen were in the Army and there\r\nwas a manpower shortage.\r\nNegroes had many terrible experiences in New York. Restaurants would not serve them. It was\r\nhard for them to find a place in\r\nwhich to live. Their co- workers often mistreated them.\r\nJames experiences made him angry. He was full of hatred. He\r\nwanted to smash someone. He\r\nwanted to kill.\r\n\r\nOne night he went to a movie\r\nwith a friend. After the movie they\r\ndecided to stop at a dinner for a\r\nbite to eat. When they entered\r\nthe counterman roared \"What do\r\nyou want?\"\r\n\r\n\"We want a hamburger and a\r\ncup of coffee. What do you think\r\nwe want,\" snapped James?\r\n\r\n\"We don't serve Negroes here,\"\r\nThe counterman hissed!\r\n\r\nAs they walked along James' anger began to build up. It filled him,\r\nblinded him, maddened him! He\r\nwas in a frenzy. Just then a fancy\r\nrestaurant came into sight. He was\r\npositive they wouldn't serve him.\r\nHe walked in and sat down in\r\nnearest vacant seat. The waitress\r\nappeared. She was frightened when\r\nshe saw him sitting there. She\r\ndidn't ask him what he wanted,\r\nbut told him flatly, \"We don't\r\nserve Negroes here.\"\r\n\r\nHis fury took possession of him.\r\nHe wanted to kill, kill, kill. He\r\nlooked around. There was a water\r\nmug half full of water on the table.\r\nHe snatched it an hurled it at her\r\nwith all his might. The terrified\r\nwaitress ducked quickly.\r\n\r\nWhat a close call she had. The\r\nmug smashed into the mirror behind the bar with tremendous\r\nforce. The loud crash startled the\r\ndiners. They looked at him in horror and\r\nran after him. He ran and ran. He\r\nescaped his pursuers, but not his\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nThese experiences made him bitter, but they didn't make him forget\r\n what he wanted to be. He\r\nwanted to be a good writer and\r\nhe was determined to become one.\r\nHe continued to write. He won\r\nprizes for his work.\r\n\r\nHis hard work began to pay off.\r\nHe was becoming world famous. He\r\nwent abroad. He traveled through\r\nEngland and France. He lived in\r\nParis, France for a long time. He\r\ncall it, \"the city I love.\" He met\r\nother famous writers. They exchanged ideas. Here for a time, he\r\nescaped some of the problems of\r\nbeing a Negro.\r\n\r\nHe finally returned to America,\r\nthe land he loves most deeply in\r\nspite of all its faults. America, after all, was his home. \"There is no\r\nplace like home.\"\r\n\r\nHe has a burning message for\r\nAmerica, a plea, a demand. He cries\r\nout for freedom and justice for the\r\nNegro.\r\n\r\nOn June 20, 1963 his junior high\r\nschool, Frederick Douglas, presented\r\nhim with the \"Alumnus of the\r\nYear Award.\" He was deeply\r\ntouched. He had a message for all\r\nmankind.\" Try to make the world\r\na more human place to live in.\"\r\nSome call him the spokesman\r\nof the Negro. He speaks for all\r\nmen . . . He speaks to America \"The\r\nAmerican white man must find a\r\nway to live with the Negro in order to be able to live with himself.\"",
