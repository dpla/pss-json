Why would this have frustrated the American colonists?\r\n\r\n2. Reading several pages of the [1765 Stamp Act](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/2). What kinds of products was it taxing? What was the response of the \u201cCongress\u201d in the [journal from the Congress](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/3)? What actions did colonists take? Examine the [teapot](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/5). What does it tell us about the relationship at this point between the colonists and the British?\r\n\r\n3. Reading several pages of the [British text justifying taxation](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/6). What kind of reasons and justifications are provided for the Parliament's taxation of the colonies?\r\n\r\n4. Compare and contrast the [1770 illustration of the Boston Massacre](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/7) and the [Washington Irving illustration](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/8). Given your background knowledge, which depiction is more accurate? What reasons might have motivated the other depiction?\r\n\r\n5. After reading the [letter from Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, and others](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/9), reflect on what events or actions may have been planned or considered at this meeting. What organizations may have attended or planned the meeting?\r\n\r\n6. Describe the actions and information provided in both the [Committee of Correspondence letter](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/11) and the [minutes](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/12) from the meeting. \r\n\r\n7. Provide five observations from the [four plates depicting the battle at Lexington](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/13). How do these match the firsthand account in the [deposition of a colonial militiaman](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/16)? Select a passage from the [sermon](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/17). Given your knowledge of Lexington and Concord and the plates and deposition, explain the selected sermon passage. "
