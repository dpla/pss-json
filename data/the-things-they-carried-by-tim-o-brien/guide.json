How is the [letter from Bobbie Lou Pendergrass to President Kennedy](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/301) similar? How is it different?\r\n\r\n2. Using photographs and television clips in this set, identify similarities and differences between forms of protest during the Vietnam War and today. How do characters in *The Things They Carried* express dissent or ambivalence toward the Vietnam War?\r\n\r\n3. In the chapter \u201cSpin,\u201d Tim O\u2019Brien writes: \u201cOn occasions the war was like a Ping-Pong ball. You could put fancy spin on it. You could make it dance.\u201d Explain the \u201cfancy spin\u201d the U.S. Army puts on the war in the [clip from a U.S. Army film](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/302).\r\n\r\n4. O\u2019Brien arrived in Vietnam a year after the My Lai massacre of 1968. After reading the [excerpt from the transcription of the 1970 military hearings](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/310), explain how Tim O\u2019Brien (the character) might have reacted to learning about this atrocity? Find a piece of textual evidence from the novel to support your argument.\r\n"
