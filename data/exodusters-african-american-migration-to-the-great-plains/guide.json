      "text": "1. Based on the [newspaper article about the state convention](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1660), the [broadside advertising migration to Kansas](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1662), the lyrics for \u201c[The Land that Gives Birth to Freedom](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1663),\u201d and [Benjamin Singleton\u2019s testimony](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1673), what were the reasons people decided to leave the South? What were the pull factors driving people to go to Kansas?\r\n2. Analyze the religious imagery used to describe leaving for Kansas in the lyrics for \u201c[The Land that Gives Birth to Freedom](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1663).\u201d How might this religious messaging have informed African Americans\u2019 decisions to leave? Briefly research the Biblical significance of the word, *Exodus*. How does the Biblical meaning relate to the Exoduster Movement?\r\n3. Based on the [letter from John Turner](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1665) and the illustration from *[Frank Leslie\u2019s Illustrated Newspaper](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1666)*, in what ways did the St. Louis black community support the Exodusters? Why do you think it was important to members of that community to help the Exodusters?\r\n4. What do the [photograph of the steamboat](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1667), the [print from *Frank Leslie\u2019s Illustrated Newspaper*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1666), and the [print from *Harper\u2019s Weekly*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1668) reveal about how people traveled from the South to Kansas?\r\n5. At the end of [Benjamin Singleton\u2019s testimony](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1673), he calls himself \u201cthe father of the exodus.\u201d Using the [broadside advertising migration to Kansas](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1662), the lyrics for \u201c[The Land that Gives Birth to Freedom](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1663),\u201d the [photograph of the steamboat](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1667), and [Benjamin Singleton\u2019s testimony](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1673), evaluate how Singleton\u2019s work to organize migration to Kansas provided a model and inspiration for the Exodus. Highlight evidence in the sources about the St. Louis aid efforts and the illustrations of Exodusters en route that supports the idea that the Exodus was more organic than any one promoter could claim responsibility for.\r\n6. Compare the depictions of \u201cold\u201d and \u201cnew\u201d styles of Exodus in the [illustration from *Harper\u2019s Weekly*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1668). How do they represent different travel experiences? What challenges or obstacles are evident in the depiction of the \u201cnew\u201d style of Exodus?\r\n7. Based on the [excerpt from the Kansas Freedmen\u2019s Relief Association report](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1669), what specific kinds of support did this organization provide to the Exodusters?\r\n8. What does the [photograph of the church building in Nicodemus](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1671) suggest about the early years of the town\u2019s history? Using the [map of Graham County](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1672), what can you infer about what life may have been like in the region surrounding Nicodemus? Using the [map of Exoduster towns](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1664), explore where some of the nearest African American communities were for the residents of Nicodemus.\r\n9. Using the [map of Exoduster towns](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1664), examine the locations of black communities in Kansas and Oklahoma. Considering factors like climate, neighboring populations, and topography, what experiences and challenges do you think may have been common across these communities? In what ways might life in Kansas and Oklahoma towns have been different? Do outside research to explore what African American life was like in Oklahoma and other places on the Great Plains beyond Kansas during the late nineteenth century."

      "text": "Ask students to create a fictional character who participated in the Exoduster Movement in the spring of 1879. Have students plot their character\u2019s journey on a map and annotate key places or moments on the trip. Students should consider factors such as where their characters originally lived, why they decided to leave the South, their travel route and experiences, and their decision about where to settle. Students should use the images and documents about the travel experience in this set to incorporate details into their annotations. Students may also use the [map of Exoduster towns](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1664) to select a place that their character would settle. Students should also consider what initial steps their character might take upon arriving in that town to establish a home and begin to support a family there."
