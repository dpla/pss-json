      "text": "1. Carefully read the [opening pages of *Sister Carrie*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1634), focusing on how Dreiser introduces Carrie Meeber and Charles Drouet on a railroad car. How does each character understand the idea that clothes make the man (or woman)? How does Dreiser set up the role of luck versus the role of fate in shaping the future of modern American young people?\r\n2. Throughout his career, Dreiser was accused of \u201cimmorality\u201d and his works were subject to censorship. Read [Dreiser\u2019s new foreword](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1635) to *Sister Carrie* and consider the novel\u2019s treatment of Carrie\u2019s relationships with various men. What do you think was so scandalous about this in the early twentieth century? (You might also compare his treatment of extramarital sex to other novels, such as [Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s *The Scarlet Letter*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sets/the-scarlet-letter-by-nathaniel-hawthorne) or [Kate Chopin\u2019s *The Awakening*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sets/the-awakening-by-kate-chopin).)\r\n3. Review the photographs of the Marshall Field and Co. department store\u2019s [exterior](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1636), [interior](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1637), and [shopping district](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1638) in downtown Chicago. Compare to Chapter III of *Sister Carrie*, when Carrie seeks work at a department store. How do the elaborate displays of material goods shape Carrie\u2019s behavior in the novel? How do these beautifully designed shopping palaces shape consumer activity? How do they shape the character of Chicago as a city?\r\n4. Carefully read chapter IV of the novel, when Carrie looks for work. How are her experiences as an unskilled laborer similar to, or different from, those of the turn-of-the-century women and children in the [photograph of young children](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1639), the [excerpt from Bessie Van Vorst\u2019s essay](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1640), and the [excerpt from *Twenty Years at Hull-House*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1641)? \r\n5. In the [excerpt from a report on urban development](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1642) and the [clip from a film on urbanization](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1643), we see how rapidly urbanization and industrialization transformed the United States, including previously small cities like Chicago. Review these sources, as well as the [excerpt on social Darwinism](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1644) and consider how these changes created new opportunities for anonymity, as some people reinvented themselves, while others become lost. What does Dreiser suggest accounts for some people\u2019s success and others\u2019 failures in this environment? Locate passages in *Sister Carrie* that demonstrate some of the tenets of social Darwinism.\r\n6. In the [excerpt from *Theodore Dreiser, America\u2019s Foremost Novelist*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1645), Harris Merton Lyon quotes William Marion Reedy as saying \u201cThank God Dreiser hasn\u2019t got *style*. If he ever gets a style, it\u2019s good-bye.\u201d Randolph Bourne describes Dreiser as \u201ccomplicated, but in a very understandable American way, the product of the uncouth forces of small-town life and the vast disorganization of the wider American world. As he reveals himself, it is a revelation of a certain broad level of the American soul.\u201d Read the [opening pages of *Sister Carrie*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1634) and analyze it with these quotations in mind. Do you think Dreiser\u2019s text lacks *style*? Discuss whether *Sister Carrie* tells its story with or without literary or artistic flourishes. How does Dreiser\u2019s particular style or lack of style function to drive the storytelling? \r\n7. Read the [excerpt](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1646) and analyze the [illustration](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1647) from Augustin Daly\u2019s melodrama *Under the Gaslight*. Closely read the scene from the novel when Carrie performs in this play to great acclaim (Chapter XVI). What kind of part is it that Carrie is playing? What makes her particularly effective in the role? "

      "text": "1. Have a classroom debate on the role of literature in reflecting versus enforcing morality. Have one side represent Theodore Dreiser defending his novel, and the other side represent outraged community members who want to ban or censor his books.\r\n2. Ask students to create posters advertising Carrie\u2019s performance in *Under the Gaslight*. They should review the [excerpt](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1646) and the [illustration](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1647) from *Under the Gaslight* for ideas, as well as Chapter XVI of *Sister Carrie*.\r\n3. Ask students to create a modern social media profile for Carrie Meeber. They should imagine a text message exchange between Carrie and Hurstwood at the end of the novel, as their fates diverge."
