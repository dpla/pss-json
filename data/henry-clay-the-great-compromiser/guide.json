Use the [map of the Missouri Compromise](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/513), the [speech excerpts on the tariff compromise](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/517), and the [painting of Henry Clay](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/521) speaking to the Senate, together with your prior knowledge of these compromises, to explain how Henry Clay attempted to prevent the Civil War. \r\n3. Using the charts, graphs, and excerpts in the [appendices](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/514), create a chart of reasons Henry Clay argued for the \u201cAmerican System.\u201d\r\n4. Using the excerpts of [John White\u2019s](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/515) and [Lynn Boyd\u2019s](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/516) speeches, outline the evidence for and against the accusations of a \u201ccorrupt bargain\u201d in the election of 1824. \r\n5. Several items outline Henry Clay\u2019s political viewpoints. Would you, like the \u201c[professed christian](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/519),\u201d have voted for Henry Clay in the election of 1844? Why?\r\n6. Use the two sections excerpted from the [pamphlet by John Hill](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/520), \u201cNegro Equality\u201d and \u201cAbolitionism Generally,\u201d to explain how the views of Henry Clay and Abraham Lincoln compare and contrast.\r\n7. Use the [images of the funeral remembrances](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/522) and five of the [letters](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/523) to explain how Henry Clay was perceived by the American public and his fellow politicians at the time of his death."
