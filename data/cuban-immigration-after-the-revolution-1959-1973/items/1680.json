It was originally published in the *Valley Times* with an article titled \u201cFamily Bares Castro Ordeal\u201d that partially reads: \"Members of the Sanz family no longer live in Cuba. They left their country more than a year ago\u2014their home in Havana, their coffee plantations in Oriente Province, their personal and business possessions, their friends and relations. Most members of the family now live in a Van Nuys apartment\u2026 'They took everything from us. It is all gone with the wind,' Enrique Sanz, a 40-year-old civil engineer, said\u2026 'Castro split the Cuban society by forcing the rich to fight the poor, the worker to fight the manufacturer, the resident to fight the owner. That is the way they will continue to work. And they will take over everything unless the United States stops them\u2014and soon.'\" ",
