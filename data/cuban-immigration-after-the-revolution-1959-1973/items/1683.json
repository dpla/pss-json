  "text": "The Truth About Cuba Committee was a non-profit organization established by Cuban exiles in Miami in 1961. Their mission was to educate Americans and fellow refugees about communist Cuba and its role in promoting communism throughout Latin America. They published bulletins and reports like this one to draw attention to the repressive activities of Castro\u2019s government in Cuba. The first page of this publication is a map of prisons and concentration camps (described in Spanish), then the second and third pages list the numbers of men and women detained in various kinds of prisons in each Cuban province.\r\n\r\nEnglish translation of the text on the map:\r\n\r\nTitle: Cuba: Captive Island\r\n\r\n\"Nuestra Denuncia\" box at top right: <br>\r\nOur Complaint<br>\r\nThis map shows how our island has been turned into a huge political prison. The number of prisons and prisoners has been carefully ascertained by the commission for humane treatment of political prisoners in Cuba and the Cuban Commission for Human Rights.<br>\r\n\r\nTo this we must add 108 slave labor farms operated by the \"recruits\" for the new Compulsory Military Service.\r\n\r\nThis graphic has been prepared under the direction of Dr. Miguel A. Olba Benito, Secretary of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights, and Advisor in this matter of the Committee of Cuban Youth Organizations in Exile.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sumario Cuantitivo\" box at top center:<br>\r\nQuantitative summary of the Captivity of the Cuban people\r\n\r\n12,000 executed on the walls<br>\r\n100,000 political prisoners (70,000 in prisons and jails and 30,000 in concentration camps and farms)<br>\r\n23 concentration camps scattered throughout the island<br>\r\n56 prisons and jails and 9 state, criminal farms (See the reverse of this chart, list of 99 penal farms established after the preparation of this work).<br>\r\nHalf Million exiled Cubans<br>\r\nSix million Cuban slaves on Captive Island",
