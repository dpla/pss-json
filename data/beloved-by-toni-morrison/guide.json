Explain the story of Medea in your own words and hypothesize why it continues to fascinate. Now evaluate how the images called \u201c[The Jealousy of Medea](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/577)\u201d and \u201c[Medea musing on the murder of her children](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/578)\u201d portray Medea. Describe how *Beloved* updates the Medea myth, using examples from Part One of the novel.\r\n2. Consider the [illustration of Margaret Garner](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/579) as the \u201cModern Medea.\u201d Compare its representation of Garner to Morrison\u2019s depiction of Sethe in *Beloved*. How are Garner and Sethe similar? In what ways are they different?\r\n3. Using the [Fugitive Slave Act](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/580), the excerpt from [Martha Browne Griffin\u2019s autobiography](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/584), and the illustrations showing the [slave ship](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/581), the [mother separated from her children](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/582), and the [shackles](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/583), discuss why death may seem better than a life enslaved.\r\n4. Identify something you learned from the [map of the Underground Railroad](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/585). Explain how the [illustration captioned \u201cthe road to liberty\u201d](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/586) portrays the Underground Railroad. How does the illustration compare to Sethe\u2019s experience escaping from slavery in *Beloved* and/or recent representations of African Americans escaping from slavery, such as the film *12 Years a Slave*?"

      "text": "Sethe is acquitted in *Beloved*, but was she right to choose death for her children over life in slavery? After students read the novel and review how the primary sources in this set depict enslaved life, ask students to put Sethe on trial to determine whether she is guilty or innocent of the murder of her daughter. Assign students to two teams, prosecution and defense. Each team will argue for Sethe\u2019s guilt or innocence, drawing on evidence from the novel and the primary sources above and evaluating the consequences of the choices available to her.\r\n"
