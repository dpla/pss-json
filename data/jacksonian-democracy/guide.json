Using the two presidential vetoes, explain why Jackson vetoed the [Maysville Road Bill](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/137) and the [Bank of the United States bill](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/138). Could these vetoes be seen as democratic or nationalistic?\r\n\r\n2. According to Jackson\u2019s 1833 [message about nullification](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/139) and the [ode by James Nack](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/140), what is nullification? What is Jackson\u2019s message to the South Carolinians during the Nullification Crisis? Could Jackson\u2019s words be seen as an act of preserving the union?\r\n\r\n3. While viewing the [images of \u201chard times tokens\u201d](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/141) and the [political cartoon about public opinion regarding Jackson and bank deposits](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/142), determine whether a President could/should take actions that affect a country\u2019s economic system. Do you believe Jackson caused the Panic of 1837 by vetoing the Bank of the United States?\r\n\r\n4. Using [Jackson\u2019s message to Congress concerning Indian Removal](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/143) and the [1830 pamphlet by the Cherokee nation](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/144), determine whether Indian Removal was a democratic action taken by the federal government or an invasion of Cherokee sovereignty.\r\n\r\n5. Using the [1830 engraving](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/134), the [illustrations](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/135), the [printed copy of Jackson\u2019s inaugural address](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/136), and the [1842 poem](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/145), explain how Jackson remembered in the American consciousness? Should this memory be preserved or should it change with the times and our understanding of democratic ideals?"

      "text": "1. Write an essay arguing whether Andrew Jackson\u2019s actions as president were democratic or nationalistic. What do each of these terms mean? Determine your stance through research and discovery and defend your choice by citing specific sources in the document set.\r\n\r\n2. In the [1833 ode](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/140), the author mockingly compares Andrew Jackson to George Washington. Use this ode and other items in this set to compare the military service and presidency of the two. \r\n\r\n3. In class, hold a mock treason trial of Andrew Jackson, charging him with crimes against humanity for causing the Panic of 1837 and the Trail of Tears. Use items in this set as evidence and to prepare arguments for the trial. (Look especially at the two presidential vetoes, the [images of \u201chard times tokens\u201d](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/141), the [political cartoon about public opinion regarding Jackson and bank deposits](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/142), [Jackson\u2019s message to Congress concerning Indian Removal](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/143), the [1830 pamphlet by the Cherokee nation](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/144) and the [1842 poem](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/145)). The two sides of the trial should offer a rich debate on Jackson\u2019s political decisions. Extend your understanding of Jackson by pulling in materials from his military campaigns. Compare Jackson\u2019s choices to those of other historical players. \r\n"
