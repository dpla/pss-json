  "text": "Following the Civil War, African Americans had already already claimed voting rights and elected black representatives to Georgia\u2019s constitutional convention and the newly constituted state legislature in 1868. However, white Republicans and Democrats in the state assembly soon allied to expel all the black elected officials. Congress responded with military oversight and, by January of 1870, re-seated the black representatives a month before this ratification was issued. Georgia was the second to last of the required number of states to recognize the fifteenth amendment in order to secure its ratification. Iowa was the last required state, ratifying the amendment the following day, on February 3, 1870. Adoption of the amendment was required before Georgia would be re-admitted to congressional representation. Georgia was the last Confederate state readmitted to the Union.\r\n\r\nTranscript:\r\n\r\nWhereas, At the session of the Fortieth Congress, it was resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, two thirds of both houses concurring, that the following Article shall be proposed to the Legislatures of the several states as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which amendment, when it shall have been ratified by three fourths of the said Legislatures shall be valid to all intents and purposes as a part of said Constitution, namely:\r\n\r\nArticle Fifteen<br>\r\nThe right of citizens of the United States to vote, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States, or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\r\nThe Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\r\n\r\nTherefore Resolved, (if the Assembly House concur), That the said proposed Amendment to the Constitution be, and the same is hereby ratified by the Legislature of the State of Georgia.\r\n\r\nExterior: <br>\r\nResolution adopting the 15th Amendment<br>\r\nAdopted in Senate Febr[uar]y 2nd 1870\r\n\r\nA Resolution<br>\r\nWhereas, at the session of the fortieth Congress it was resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, two-thirds of both Houses concurring, that the following Article shall be proposed to the Legislatures of the several states as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which amendment, when it shall have been ratified by three-fourths of the said Legislatures, shall be valid to all intents and purposes as a part-of the said Constitution, namely, \r\n\r\nArticle Fifteenth.<br>\r\nThe right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race or color, or previous condition of servitude.<br>\r\nThe Congress shall have power to enforce this article by Appropriate legislation.\r\n\r\nTherefore, resolved, if the Senate concur, that the said proposed amendment to the Constitution be and the same is hereby ratified by the Legislature of the State of Georgia.\r\n\r\nR.
