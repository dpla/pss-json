      "text": "1. Based on a close reading of imagery in the two commemorative prints from 1870, describe how the artists believed the Fifteenth Amendment would impact African Americans\u2019 lives in addition to allowing them the power to vote?\r\n2. In what ways do the lyrics in Joshua McCarter Simpson\u2019s [song](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1216) reflect the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments in addition to the Fifteenth Amendment? How do Simpson\u2019s song lyrics compare to the imagery in the commemorative prints?\r\n3. What do the case of Octavius Catto, the [broadside](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1222) from Connecticut, and Samuel May\u2019s [letter](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1219) reveal about Northern attitudes toward the Fifteenth Amendment and the idea of black political power?\r\n4. Black leaders Henry McNeal Turner and Archibald Grimk\u00e9 wrote about the significance and impact of the Fifteenth Amendment approximately thirty-five years apart. Using [Turner\u2019s speech](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1217) and [Grimk\u00e9\u2019s essay](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1224), compare and contrast their perspectives. Based on Grimk\u00e9\u2019s analysis, describe what had changed between the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment and 1905.\r\n5. Compare the analysis in [Grimk\u00e9\u2019s essay](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1224) with that of the [*Memphis World* article](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1226) in 1960. How had strategies for securing the vote changed between 1905 and the start of the civil rights movement?"

Students can select specific members of the academy and research their lives and perspectives. At the mock meeting, students can discuss and debate strategies and ideas for securing the full promises of the Fifteenth Amendment.\r\n2. Have students create collages inspired by the commemorative prints at the beginning of the set. What would the scenes and imagery for a \u201cFifteenth Amendment\u201d print have looked like in 1905? What about in 1965? Students can research historical images from DPLA and other sources to complete their \u201cvignette\u201d collages.\r\n"
