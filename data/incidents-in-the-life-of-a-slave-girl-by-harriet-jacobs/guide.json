      "text": "1. Compare the titles given to the [1861 US edition](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1126) and the [1862 British edition](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1127) of Jacobs\u2019 book. What is the significance of the phrase \u201cthe deeper wrong\u201d? \r\n2. Dr. Norcom\u2019s advertisement for Harriet\u2019s return in 1835 offered four times as much reward as this [ad for Derry](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1129). Given the details of Jacobs\u2019 life as recounted in *Incidents*, why do you think Norcom valued her so highly?\r\n3. One of the themes Jacobs describes in *Incidents* is the constant threat slavery posed of separating families (i.e. chapter three or Harriet\u2019s conversation with Fanny in chapter thirty). Using her narrative and the [illustration from *Anti-Slavery Almanac*](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1132), the [drawing of the slave market](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1135), and the [bill of sale for Margaret](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1136), explain why this was a powerful argument for the abolitionist movement.\r\n4. Jacobs describes not only her experience of sexual predation by her enslaver but, in chapter six, how common it was to see enslaved children with light skin, often nearly \u201cwhite,\u201d that were the products of these forced relationships. How do the [photograph of Isaac and Rosa](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1138), the [runaway slave advertisements](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1131), and the [broadside advertising a slave auction](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1137) reflect American anxiety about enslaved people with light skin tones? How might the [photograph of Isaac and Rosa](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1138) have increased white Northerners\u2019 support for the Civil War and Emancipation in 1863?\r\n5. [Francis Jackson\u2019s letter](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1140) recounts how Thomas Sims, who had escaped slavery to freedom in Boston, was re-enslaved under the auspices of the Fugitive Slave Law. How did the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law impact Jacobs, her children, and her brother? What does Jackson\u2019s letter reveal about the tension between abolitionist communities and government power when it came to the lives of men and women who had escaped slavery?"

Ask students to choose another figure in *Incidents* and write an account of the same years from his or her perspective. Students might select the grandmother Molly Horniblow, Dr. James Norcom, or one of Jacobs' children, Joseph and Louisa."
