Carefully examine the works of Frank Lloyd Wright shown in the [article from *The Architectural Review*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1651), the [exhibition catalog](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1652), the [photograph of a window](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1653), the [photograph of the Frank Wright Thomas house](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1654), the [photograph of a straight back chair](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1655), the [photograph of Ward W. Willits House](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1656), and the [print of the Guggenheim Museum](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1657). Describe the style of the architecture and designed objects. What shapes do you see? How are they arranged? What materials do they use?\r\n2. Look closely at the [photograph of the window](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1653) and read the article \u201c[The Art and Craft of the Machine](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1650).\u201d How does Wright\u2019s work incorporate nature? \r\n3. Based on Wright\u2019s statements in the [interview](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1648), the [brochure](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1649), and the article \u201c[The Art and Craft of the Machine](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1650),\u201d how did he define the role of an architect? \r\n4. Look carefully at the work of Louis Sullivan shown in the essay \u201c[Louis H. Sullivan, Thinker and Architect](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1658)\u201d and review the work of Wright shown in the [article from *The Architectural Review*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1651), the [exhibition catalog](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1652), the [print of the Guggenheim Museum](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1657), and the photographs of the [window](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1653), the [Frank Wright Thomas house](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1654), the [straight back chair](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1655), and the [Ward W. Willits House](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1656). What evidence can you see of Sullivan\u2019s influence on Wright? \r\n5. According to the [article from *The Architectural Review*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1651), what was innovative about Wright\u2019s work? Why did the author find Wright\u2019s work important? Do you agree with the author\u2019s findings?"

      "text": "Have students examine [print of the Guggenheim Museum](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1657), describing the building in their own words. Working in pairs, have students choose a local building that has significance to them. This might be a building they admire or one they strongly dislike. Have students visit the building, or use Google Earth to examine the building, and draw the structure. If online or local resources allow students to research the style and architect of the building, they can take note of this information. Students should then write a brief description of the building that explains the aspects of it they like or dislike. These might comment on the appearance of the structure or the way space is used. Students may also draw an alternate version of the building incorporating their ideas for improvement."
