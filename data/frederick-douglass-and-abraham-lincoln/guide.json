In groups of two to four, students should write a speech and develop plans for a memorial which would honor Frederick Douglass. The speech and plans should be developed from Lincoln\u2019s perspective on the life, work, and accomplishments of Douglass. Students should present their speech and memorial plans to the class. This is a project which could appeal to all learners: auditory, visual, and kinesthetic. "
