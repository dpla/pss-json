         "text": "James William Alston was a First Lieutenant in the 372nd Infantry, an all-black regiment, during World War I. Alston was born in Wake County, NC on January 16, 1876. In 1907, he started working as a janitor and messenger for the State Museum, later the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. During the war, Alston wrote several letters to H. H. Brimley, who was white. Brimley was a curator and the first director of the State Museum.\r\n\r\nTranscript:\r\n\r\nNov. 1st 1918 <br>\r\nMy Dear Mr. Brimley: <br>\r\nYou will probably think that I am a long time getting back to the front, but the [illegible] here is the boss and won't let me go, but promised this morning that I could go in about ten days. My wound is all healed and with the exception of a very little stiffness I am as good as ever. There is so much talk of peace I want to get back and have another try at Fritz before the finish. I think I have pretty well\r\n\r\n[page 2]\r\n\r\nevened the score with him but I want to give him some more for good measure. Fritz can fight like the very devil when he is under cover and has the most men, but can't stand the Yankee steel and these Yankees, white and black sure love to use their bayonet whenever they can get near enough to him. I am in the southern part of France in the town of Vichy and quartered in one ------- \r\n\r\n[page 3]\r\n\r\nof the best hotels in the town. There are about one hundred officers at the hotel and I the only colored one so you know I am lonesome. I was as hungry as a dog the first night that I was here but walking in the dinning room seeing about one hundred white officer and no colored officers I lost my appetite - but it came back by morning and has stayed with since. I am treated fine by all the officers but most of them say I am\r\n\r\n[page 4]\r\n\r\na damn fool for wanting to get back to the front. I met Mr Thos. F Ryan's son he is a Sgt. in the Medical Corps he is sure one fine man, and is crazy to go to the front but the Col. won't let him. I wish you would send me Mr Garland Jones, and Bob's address so if any time I am near their outfit I can look them up. I see lots of people from the state but none from Raleigh\r\n\r\n[page 5]\r\n\r\nbut prehaps [sic] I will have luck enough to see some one before I come [crossed out in MS: go] back to the good old U.S.A. There is no news except Fritz is catching the very devil. My best regards to Mrs Brimley, Mr & Mrs Adickes [?] and all friends \r\n\r\nYours very respectfully <br>\r\nJames W Alston <br>\r\n372 R. I. U. S. \r\nS.P. 179 France",

         "text": "James William Alston was a First Lieutenant in the 372nd Infantry, an all-black regiment, during World War I. Alston was born in Wake County, NC on January 16, 1876. In 1907, he started working as a janitor and messenger for the State Museum, later the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. During the war, Alston wrote several letters to H. H. Brimley, who was white. Brimley was a curator and the first director of the State Museum.\r\n\r\nTranscript:\r\n\r\nS.P. 179 France  <br>\r\nSep. [crossed out in MS: Aug] 3, 1918 \r\n\r\nMy Dear Mr Brimley <br>\r\nI sure was glad to get your letter and to know that all is well in the good old North State. Everything is moveing [sic] fine over here so far and I think we have Fritz on the run, thanks to the good work of the people back home, and I hope we can keep him on the go until we can get a strangle holt [hold] on him, and then [underlined in MS] God help him. I want to see some of the German towns completely destroyed as I have seen the French. \r\n\r\n[page 2]\r\n\r\nHe sure has put [crossed out in MS: what] the part of France that he held on the bumb [bomb?], but the French will repay him in a not far distant date. France is one continaus[continuous] camp and the troops are coming in all the time and every one moves forward all the time, and no one gets to the rear except the wounded, even the Eugmcus [?] in the rear of the line are constantly deserting [?] to go to the front, so much so that when they are given leave they go to the front, so you see that the whole movement is constantly towards Berlin. \r\nI have seen none of the boys from Raleigh as yet\r\n\r\n[page 3]\r\n\r\nbut hope to when we all get together near Berlin. \r\nI am glad to know that my people are doing their bit to win the war, they sure make good soldiers and seem to take delight in sticking Fritz with a bayonet or clubbing him with the butt end of a rifle, but their main weapon is the hand grenade. I would send you some relics [?] for the Museum but there is a limited amount of transportation here and I am afraid that it would never reach you, but perhaps before I come back I can get something for you. \r\n\r\n[page 4]\r\n\r\nI wish if you write again that you would send me Bobs adress [address] as I would like to write to him and go to see him if I ever get close to his outfit. We have a captain Swift of Waynesville N.C. in our outfit he is commanding the Mehi [?] Gun. \r\nI have been commanding my company since July 30th and it is some job believe me. I took command while in the front line and have been in the front line all the month of August except 8 days. I hope to get a new Captain soon and if it is a white Capt. Let him be from\r\n\r\n[page 5]\r\n\r\nthe south is my prayer. \r\nThere is some friction between the officers over him but wherever it is known to exist the one in fault is promptly relieved, and wherever it exist it is generaly [generally] among the ones from the north. The officers from the south that I have met are good fellows one and all as a rule. \r\nI am writing to the new comdr. [commander] to-day asking for special duty as patrol officer and I hope I can get it as it affords a fellow a better chance for promotion and excitement all his own and then I have\r\n\r\n[page 6]\r\n\r\na score to pay Fritz for leaving a scar on my face, and I want to get him where I can fix him to my own taste [?]. \r\nMy best regards to Mrs Brimley, Mr & Mrs Adiekes [?] and all my friends, and write when you have the time to \r\n\r\nyours very respectfully <br>\r\nJames W Alston  <br>\r\n372 R. J. N. [?] S.  <br>\r\nS.P. 179 France\r\n",

In my little sector we were the reserve at the commencement but on the third day we took the line, and it was just as General Sherman said \"Hell.\" but the good work had to go on, so on we drove on the heels of Fritz, - passing him back through the lines as fast as we overtook him, killing with bayonets those who manned the machine gun nest. The French 75 high guns racing to keep up\r\n\r\n[page 3]\r\n\r\n had a hard time and my company ran two days ahead of our rolling kitchen and the men had to subsist on about 1/2 iron ration but what did the [they] care so long as they had the bosh on the run, all they want is to end the war because they have a horror of the winter over here in the trenches and you know my people are at their best in the good old summer time. \r\nI will be back with my -------------- \r\n\r\n[page 4]\r\n\r\ncompany in about a month I am told but I hate to stay away that long, and I believe every man here wants to get back and help finish a job that we think is near finished. \r\nThe prisoners are a poor looking lot and don't seem to have any fight left in them, they surrender readily where there are no officers to prevent them\r\n\r\n[page 5]\r\n\r\nThis is about all the news I have and it is no secret. My regards to all my friends in the Dept. especially Jim and tell him to keep praying and we will keep fighting. \r\n\r\nWrite when you can to yours very respectfully <br>\r\nLt. James W Alston <br>\r\n372 R. I. [?] U. S. <br>\r\nAmerican Exp Force",

What do the letters of James W. Alston tell us about the racism that African American soldiers faced in World War I as well as the patriotism they felt?\r\n3. Using the excerpt from his [1921 memoir](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/842), describe Horace Pippin\u2019s experiences in the trenches in World War I. Compare his experiences to that of James W. Alston.\r\n4. Using the excerpt from [*Complete History of the Colored Soldiers in the World War*](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/846), explain the battle actions of Henry Johnson. Why did it take until June 2015 for him to be awarded the US Congressional Medal of Honor? \r\n5. According to the [proclamation](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/847), African American soldiers were unable to complete their assignment at Camp Wadsworth. Why do you think they did not complete their assignment? Why is the reason not mentioned in this document?\r\n6. How does the [fictional account in *Colored Soldiers*](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/848) perpetuate stereotypes about African Americans? How does the account reveal tensions facing African American World War I veterans? \r\n"

But hundreds of thousands of African Americans fought on the western front to make the world \u201csafe for democracy,\u201d in President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s phrase. These soldiers came from a range of US locations\u2014cities like New York or Washington, DC as well as the countryside of the Carolinas and the Deep South. They were sources of inspiration for many in the African American community, but evoked fear among some white Americans. This primary source set emphasizes the experiences of African American doughboys during the war while also highlighting how they were perceived by white Americans. Use the sources to determine how racism and patriotism shaped the experiences of the African American soldiers."
