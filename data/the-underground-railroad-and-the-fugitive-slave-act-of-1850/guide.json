      "text": "1. Consider [*The Fugitive Slave Law and its Victims*](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1048), the [political cartoon](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1051), the drawing called [\u201cOperations of the Fugitive-Slave Law,\u201d](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1050) and the [drawing of a woman leaping](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1049). What do these show about the experiences of fugitive slaves? What were the different ways fugitive slaves fought against being sold back into slavery? \r\n2. Harriet Tubman is known for the integral role she played in the Underground Railroad, but there are details about her work that many are unaware of. Based on the [biography](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1043), explain Harriet Tubman\u2019s role in educating free African Americans. What do we learn about her character based on Frederick Douglass\u2019s letter? What are some details from the text that support the assertion that Tubman was \u201cone of the best and bravest persons on this continent?\u201d\r\n3. After reading the [Fugitive Slave Bill](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1047), explain what repercussions abolitionists faced if they were caught helping a fugitive slave. Why did abolitionists take such risks? Consider details of abolitionist assistance in [*Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom*](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1046), [*The Underground Railroad from Slavery to Freedom*](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1054), and [*A Woman's Life Work*](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1055), as well as the evidence of the [poster](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1052).\r\n"

      "text": "1. **Upper Elementary/Middle School:**\r\nThe [picture and narrative of Lear Green](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1053) can be paired with the picture book *Henry\u2019s Freedom Box* by Ellen Levine, which allows students to examine the Underground Railroad from the perspective of a child. Ask students to create a journal from the perspective of a fugitive slave child, using information from this set and *Henry\u2019s Freedom Box*. The following questions can help students develop their journal entries: What were some fears children had while trying to escape slavery? What motivated them to remain resilient? What do we learn about the importance of liberty and freedom based on these texts? \r\n2. **Middle School:**\r\nUse the drawing of [Maria Weems](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1044), the [drawing of Ellen Craft](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1045), the drawing called [\u201cOperations of the Fugitive-Slave Law,\u201d](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1050) and the excerpt from [*A Woman's Life Work*](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1055) in conjunction with novels about similar topics. For example, *War Comes to Willy Freeman*, by Christopher and James Lincoln Collier, deals with the issue of women having to disguise themselves in order to survive slavery and war in the United States. Ask students to create posters that portray the trauma enslaved women experienced, explain what motivated them to escape, and describe extreme sacrifices they had to make in order to protect themselves and their children. The class can engage in a gallery walk in which students view each other\u2019s posters and provide feedback. (This activity can be extended to high school if used with Toni Morrison\u2019s *Beloved*.) \r\n3. **High School/College:**\r\n[*The Underground Railroad from Slavery to Freedom* by William M. Mitchell](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1054) is an excellent resource to include in a curriculum that incorporates Frederick Douglass\u2019s *Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass* and Solomon Northup\u2019s *Twelve Years a Slave*. (The movie would also be a great text to include in the curriculum.) Ask students to write an essay that examines the similarities between the experiences of the three abolitionists, comparing and contrasting rhetorical strategies they used to gain allies in the abolitionist movement. \r\n"
