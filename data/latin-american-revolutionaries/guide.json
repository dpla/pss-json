Using the [map of colonies](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/901), describe the various geographic features that promoted and/or discouraged communication and unification in Latin America. What do you notice about the geography of cities highlighted on the map and the geography of battle sites?\r\n2. After reading the biographical information about each of the leaders included in this set, draw comparisons between them with regard to their motivation for liberation and independence and their plans for the new nations they fought to free.\r\n3. Read the [excerpt from J.R. Beard\u2019s biography](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/906). What are the major similarities between L\u2019Ouverture and Napoleon Bonaparte? How were these two men different?\r\n4. Look at the [portrait of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/908) and the [image of a statue of Bol\u00edvar](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/910). What other figures throughout history have been clad in such a way? What do you think the artist\u2019s intent was when choosing such attire? Look at other portraits in this set and analyze how each of the freedom fighters are depicted.\r\n"
