Using the [1940 booklet](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/937), [1972 pamphlet](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/938), and [1975 booklet](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/939), describe the original Food Stamp Program established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the New Deal and discuss how the program has transformed over time. How would you compare and contrast the program of the 1940s with the program of the 1970s and today\u2019s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)? How would you improve today\u2019s SNAP program? \r\n2. Using the [1972 pamphlet](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/938), explain why you think reforms were needed to the Food Program of 1964. Do you think the reforms were successful? Why or why not? \r\n3. Using the [1940 booklet](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/937) and the [2012 analysis](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/945), explain whether or not you think that food stamp programs play a critical role in alleviating poverty. \r\n4. Based on the [1939 political cartoon](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/941), why do you think Congress presented opposition to President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s food subsidy program? \r\n"

Provide a week\u2019s worth of food coupons to each group. Using the appropriate guidelines for each era, ask students to develop a shopping list and a week\u2019s list of meals to feed a family of four based on research about the price of food in the late 1930s. Does each group have enough food stamps to feed the entire family? Are each of the meals balanced? Was each group able to purchase everything it needed? Why did each group choose the items purchased? \r\n"
