These schools, predominantly run by Christian missionaries, were often funded by the federal government and worked to \u201ccivilize\u201d Native American children, forcing many to abandon their names, cultures, and identities in the process. This collection of photos and documents shows what life was like for the many children enrolled in American Indian boarding schools."
