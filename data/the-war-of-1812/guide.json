How does the [image of the council](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/498) between William Henry Harrison and Native American leaders help us to understand the differences between the Native American peoples who resided in the \u201cOld Northwest\u201d and the increasing number of white American settlers? Describe Tecumseh\u2019s steps after this fateful gathering.\r\n2. Using the items in this set, describe the importance of transatlantic trade to the young United States. How were the steps of Great Britain before the War of 1812 negatively impacting both the US and British trade interests?\r\n3. In the [American declaration of war](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/502), which governmental body declares war on Great Britain? Who is the affirming President? Who is Speaker of the House of Representatives?\r\n4. What does the [image of Fort George](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/503) show us about the proximity of the US and British-Canadian forces? What can you suppose about pre- and post-war relations between these two sides?\r\n5. Use the [\u201cNaval Heroes\u201d image](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/504) and the [1813 poem](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/505) to describe the country's view of Oliver Hazard Perry. What did he do to earn this acclaim?\r\n6. Use the [medallion](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/506) to help describe the Battle of the Thames. Why would a Kentucky governor be on the flip side of the coin?\r\n7. Use the [1816 description of the Battle of Baltimore](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/507) and the [sheet music to \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner\u201d](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/508) to describe what happened in the Battle of Baltimore and why it received accolades in song.\r\n8. Given the [1816 description of the Battle of New Orleans](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/507), [Andrew Jackson\u2019s account](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/509), and the [image of the *Constitution*](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/510), explain how the tide turned towards the end of the war.\r\n9. What does the [letter from Benjamin Hawkins](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/511) tell us about the steps taken to announce the end of the war?\r\n"

      "text": "Using the sources, students should create a news segment on the War of 1812. Students should report in from the various battle sites covered in the documents. Additionally, a special report should be given on relations with Native Americans. Other segments may include updates on new music and poetry. Finally, a panel should give commentary on the lasting outcome of the War and its impact on the United States, Great Britain, Canada, and Native Americans. Tasks will need to be assigned, research done, scripts written, storyboards created, and, finally, presented (perhaps videotaped and then presented)."
