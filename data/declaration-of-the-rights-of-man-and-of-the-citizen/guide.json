Look at the text of the [Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/889). How does this document embody the French Revolution ideas of liberty, equality, and fraternity? Categorize the main points of the Declaration itself into these three ideas. What concepts from the Declaration are left out?\r\n3. The [Magna Carta](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/892), Locke\u2019s [*Two Treatises of Government*](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/893), the [Virginia Bill of Rights](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/895), and the [US Bill of Rights](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/896) all contributed to the ideas found in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. Choose one of the contributing documents and describe what particular ideas the document offered to the Declaration. Cite specific textual evidence that links the document to the Declaration.\r\n4. The [Virginia Bill of Rights](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/895) states that \u201call men are by nature equally free and independent and have certain inherent rights.\u201d It was passed and adopted at a time when Virginians (and many of the framers and signers of this document) were enslaving people of African descent. What questions does this document raise about the United States\u2019s involvement in the \u201cpeculiar institution\u201d of slavery?\r\n5. Trace the ideals of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen through the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/897), the events of the [Seneca Falls Convention](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/898), the [letter from Ho Chi Minh](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/899), and the [\u201cUS Human Rights Policy Toward Africa.\u201d](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/900) How do ideals of the Declaration still permeate governments and societies around the world today? \r\n"
