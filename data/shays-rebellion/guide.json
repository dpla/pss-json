What are some ways the illustrator\u2019s choices, such as character detail and perspective, reinforce differences? How does this drawing tap into broader ideas about the government and its roles that were at the heart of the rebellion?\r\n2. Why do you think [an act](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/736) prohibiting rebels from serving on a jury was of particular importance? In what ways does this act reflect the broader issues of the rebellion? \r\n3. Compare the excerpts from [Minot\u2019s book](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/741) and from the [address of the general court](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/742). How does each describe the debt crisis? Where is the blame for the crisis placed? Is there a call to action? If so, what? \r\n4. How did the Shaysites\u2019 rebellion and their motives for rebellion impact the creation of the Constitution? Use the items in this set to illustrate your answer."

What arguments could students make to appeal to Massachusetts residents? What other ideas might residents have about the roles and responsibilities of the government? Of citizens?
