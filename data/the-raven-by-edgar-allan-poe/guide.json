      "text": "1. Examine the two portraits of Poe. How does each portrait characterize Poe as an artist within Gothic literature/Dark Romanticism? Cite specific evidence from the portraits to support your ideas.\r\n2. After reading the letters from [Washington Irving](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/760) and [Nathaniel Hawthorne](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/761), describe their relationships to Poe. If you have read additional works by these authors, how do Poe\u2019s themes and subjects compare/contrast with theirs? Do you see their influence in \u201cThe Raven\u201d?\r\n3. Closely examine the [Manet illustration](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/762) and the [1883 book cover](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/763). Which themes and ideas from \u201cThe Raven\u201d do they capture? How do they depict the relationship between the poem\u2019s speaker and the raven? How do they describe the setting? Any details that surprise you based on your own interpretation of the poem?\r\n4. According to Poe\u2019s essay, \u201c[The Philosophy of Composition](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/764),\u201d what were Poe\u2019s primary considerations and motivations for writing \u201cThe Raven?\u201d What questions does the essay raise for you as a reader of the poem? What does it tell us about the way poetry was discussed in Poe\u2019s time? \r\n5. Read the two parodies of \u201cThe Raven\u201d: \u201c[The Parrot](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/766)\u201d and \u201c[The Dove](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/767).\u201d These are only two of the many parodies that have been made of \u201cThe Raven.\u201d What commentary do they provide on the original poem? What does the degree to which it has been parodied tell us about \u201cThe Raven\u201d?\r\n6. Examine the [1848 book review](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/765) from *The Southern Quarterly Review*. What is the author\u2019s assessment of Poe and \u201cThe Raven\u201d? With which points do you agree/disagree?\r\n7. Read Poe\u2019s poem, \u201c[Lenore](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/768).\u201d Compare the role of Lenore in \u201cThe Raven\u201d with the subject of \u201cLenore.\u201d\r\n8. How does the [1956 political cartoon](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/769) use \u201cThe Raven\u201d as a metaphor? What does \u201cThe Raven\u201d represent?"

      "text": "Ask students to write a letter to the editor in response to either Poe\u2019s essay, \u201c[The Philosophy of Composition](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/764),\u201d or the [1848 book review](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/765). Use the following questions to guide the letter writing:\r\n\r\n* What, in your opinion, are the most compelling and/or troubling things about the poem?\r\n* To what extent do you agree with the author?\r\n* Where does he get it wrong?\r\n* What ideas about \u201cThe Raven\u201d would you like to have seen him address?\r\n* What questions do you have after reading his piece?\r\n\r\nStudents can also stage this activity as a debate in which they take positions for and against the review in *The Southern Quarterly Review*."
