Using the items in this set, describe some of the challenges of life in the 1860s. What were some challenges faced by women specifically?\r\n\r\n4. Compare and contrast the photograph of models in the 1940s and the illustration from the 1860s. What are the differences between formal and everyday clothing? How can these clothes help us understand the changing circumstances of Amy in *Little Women*?\r\n"
