How do these speeches presage the conflicts that will lead to secession and civil war? How do they frame the central issues differently? \r\n2. Read the [letter from A. A. Echols](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/772) to former Massachusetts governor Emory Washburn. How does Echols understand regional and political differences around slavery and its extension? How does Echols predict secession will play out?\r\n3. Compare and contrast the official documents citing reasons for [South Carolina](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/774)\u2019s and [Texas](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/775)\u2019s secession from the Union.\r\n4. Examine the [sheet music](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/776) for the \u201cGrand Secession March,\u201d the \u201c[Epitaph on the United States of America](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/777),\u201d the [lithograph of Davis\u2019s inauguration](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/778), and the broadside of \u201c[Jeff. Davis in the White House](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/779).\u201d How did the creators of Secession and Confederate States of America propaganda understand that identity? How and why did they reimagine the political conflicts that led to secession?\r\n5. Using the [broadside announcing defeat](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/780) and the [print of a Union volunteer](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/781), explain how the events at Fort Sumter were understood differently in the North and South. What actions did the events at Fort Sumter prompt for each region?\r\n6. Citing evidence on the [1862 map](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/782), explain the impact of secession on the Union by 1862.\r\n7. How does [Robert E. Lee\u2019s amnesty oath](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/783) retroactively characterize secession? How does it understand the relationship between the Confederate States of America and the United States of America after the war? "

      "text": "Break the class into pairs or small groups and use the [1862 map](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/782) to identify the states that seceded from the Union. Assign each pair or group a state (including the initial seven and the border states but excluding South Carolina) and ask them to create a brief presentation about the secession history of their assigned state. Using the Digital Public Library of America and other resources, they should locate the official document listing a rationale for secession and summarize its reasoning in their presentation. The presentation should also include a timeline of major events on the state\u2019s road to secession. Groups should present their findings to the class. The whole class should then discuss the ways in which other states\u2019 stories of and reasons for secession are similar to or different from [South Carolina](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/774)\u2019s.
