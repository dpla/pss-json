Compare his experience to that of Sergeant Holden in [Holden\u2019s journal](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/215). What can we learn from these sources about soldiers\u2019 experience of the war? \r\n\r\n2. Use the letter to William Pitt and the British history of the war to learn about the British perspective on the war. What do the sources tell us about England\u2019s reason for fighting? Are the sources biased?\r\n\r\n3. Use the [account of speeches and treaties](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/213) to learn about the Native American perspective on the war. Why did they fight? What did they hope to win?\r\n\r\n4. Use the letter at the end of [George Washington\u2019s diary](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/210) and the map to learn about the French perspective on the war. Why did they fight? What did they hope to win?\r\n\r\n5. Analyze the [medal](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/216) commemorating the capture of Montreal. What symbols appear on the medal? What do they represent? Do we use similar symbols today? "
