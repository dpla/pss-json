Using the items in this set, explain in what ways the actions of women on the home front debunk stereotypical myths about women\u2019s roles during the era.\r\n"

Based on the primary source documents in the set, write a letter to your World War II soldier-husband about your experiences on the home front. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, assume the role of your gender. Male students should write to a wife/girlfriend/sister/mother at home asking questions about home and work during World War II. Female students should write a letter to a boyfriend/husband/brother/father explaining their jobs/home life during World War II. "
