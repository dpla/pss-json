Based on the [map of Puerto Rico](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1141) and information in the atlas, what were the primary economic activities in Puerto Rico in the 1950s? \r\n2. What does the [airline map](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1142) reveal about the most popular destinations from San Juan in 1965? What do these places have in common?\r\n3. Based on the [*Puerto Rican Farm Workers in Florida* report](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1144) and the [statement on \u201cThe Puerto Rican Farm Labor Program,\u201d](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1145) explain in what ways farm labor migration programs were successful. In what ways did this practice make Puerto Rican works vulnerable to economic exploitation? Using the sources, compare the motivations and experiences of urban and rural migrants.\r\n4. Lolita Lebr\u00f3n is sometimes remembered as a freedom fighter, a revolutionary, or as a terrorist. In what ways does she fit (or not fit) each definition? Based on the design and wording on the [postcard](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1150) and the [poster](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1151), how do you think the creator of each would label her?\r\n5. Based on the [schools report](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1147) and the [*Memphis World* article about colleges](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1148), explain how Puerto Rican migration impacted New York\u2019s education system. \r\n6. Based on Governor Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00een\u2019s quotation in the description for the [photo](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1143) and the resources about Lolita Lebr\u00f3n, compare each of their worldviews about Puerto Rico\u2019s relationship with the United States. \r\n7. Using the [article about Roberto Clemente](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1155), explain the significance of Clemente and his success for Puerto Rican communities in the US."

      "text": "*West Side Story* is one of the most widely known representations of Puerto Rican culture and identity during the 1950s and 1960s. Watch the film and research its reception within Puerto Rican communities. Using the [photograph of Rita Moreno](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1152) and [others from DPLA](http://dp.la/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%22west+side+story%22), consider the ways in which the film created or reinforced stereotypes about Puerto Rican culture and gender roles. Ask students to consider/write a reflection: How might *West Side Story* have been different if it was written and produced by Puerto Ricans?"
