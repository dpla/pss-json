How does your answer relate to the experiences and ambitions of the Younger family in the play? \r\n\r\n2. Using the photographs of the [domestic](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/20) and the [chauffeur](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/21) as evidence, explain what kinds of professions were available to African Americans in the postwar period. Where do the occupations depicted appear in this play? What impact do they have on the characters? \r\n\r\n3. Using the [photo of African American women in 1950s attire](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/22), the [photo of a bride and groom in traditional Nigerian dress](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/23), and the [photo of a female customer at the Natural Kuumba Hair Salon](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/24), describe the transformation that Beneatha undergoes during *A Raisin in the Sun*. What does this transformation signify about her changing identity?\r\n\r\n4. Despite the setback during the Karl Lindner visit, the Youngers proceed with their plans to move. Using the [photo of crowd gathering after the arrest of a white supremacist group](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/25) and the [television news clip](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/26) as evidence, explain some of the challenges that might await them in Clybourne Park.\r\n"
