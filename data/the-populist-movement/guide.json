Based on a close examination of the [campaign button](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/466), [campaign ribbon](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/467), and [Watson photograph](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/468), explain how the Populist party appealed to voters.\r\n2. What were some personal characteristics of Populists like Jim Weaver (as explained in the [biography](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/470))? How did those characteristics cater to the Populists voters?\r\n3. In the [NC Congress speech](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/471), Isaac Smith, an African American Republican congressman, responded to C.H. Johnson, a white Populist congressman, by criticizing the Populist party for exploiting black voters. Why would the Populist party attract black voters? \r\n4. In the last paragraph of the [broadside](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/473), the writer encourages farmers to mobilize for action. What are his main arguments and how do they reflect the Populist party? Provide a contemporary example of the \u201clittle man\u201d against the \u201cgiant corporation.\u201d\r\n"

Ask students to compare and contrast the Populist party and the contemporary Tea Party or Green Party, writing a two-to-three-page argumentative essay explaining how and why there are similarities and differences between the parties.\r\n"
