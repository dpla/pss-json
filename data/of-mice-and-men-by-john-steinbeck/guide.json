      "text": "1. Read the [excerpt from *The Novels of John Steinbeck*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1802). In the excerpt, Moore discusses how the novella *Of Mice and Men* lends itself to a stage production. He even goes on to say that \u201cthe final shaping of it depends upon the artist\u2019s own vision.\u201d What modern actor would you cast in the stage production as Lennie? Who would you cast as George? Think about the characteristics each of these men possesses. Use textual evidence to defend your choice.\r\n2. Read the [excerpt from *Legislation for the Feeble-Minded*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1804). In the novel, Lennie is described as simple-minded, almost childlike. In the pamphlet, where would Lennie fall under the \u201cfour classes of mental defectives\u201d within the meaning of the act? Do you think Lennie would benefit from any of the legislation in this act? Why or why not? How does the language in this pamphlet reflect the attitude of the time towards people with disabilities? \r\n3. Examine the [photograph of the insane asylum](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1805). What can you tell about the conditions of this insane asylum? Why might George not have wanted Lennie to go to such a place?\r\n4. Examine the images of actual migrant workers and migrant worker characters in this set: the [photograph of two migrant workers](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1806), the [photograph of workers gathering seedlings](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1807), the [photograph of workers in the San Joaquin Valley](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1808), the [photograph of the college stage production](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1809), and the [photograph of men playing cards](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1810). Find a piece of textual evidence from the novel that could \u201ccaption\u201d each picture.\r\n5. Read the Robert Burns poem \u201c[To a Mouse](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1811).\u201d Steinbeck titled *Of Mice and Men* after this poem. What is the poem about? How does the poem relate to the novella? Use textual evidence to support your answer.\r\n6. How does the [drawing of the ranch](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1812) compare to Steinbeck\u2019s vision of the ranch where Lennie and George work? This drawing depicts a farm sixty years prior to the setting in *Of Mice and Men*. What are some aspects of the drawing that are antiquated?\r\n7. Throughout the novella, George describes the small farm they are going to buy and then \u201clive off the fatta the lan\u2019.\u201d Look at the [architectural drawing of a small farm and residence](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1813). How does this compare to the description George gives Lennie of the stake they plan to buy? How is it different? Do some research. How much would a place like that cost in the 1930s?\r\n8. The [Dr. Seuss political cartoon](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1814) is an allusion to *Of Mice and Men*. What historical event does the political cartoon depict? How does it represent the themes in Steinbeck\u2019s *Of Mice and Men*?\r\n9. From the death of Curley\u2019s wife to the mercy shooting of Lennie by George, violence is prevalent throughout *Of Mice and Men*. How does David Smith\u2019s sketch \u201c[Private Law and Order Leagues](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1815)\u201d depict violence? What images within the drawing stand out in particular? What can you infer about the drawing and its relationship to the scene involving Crooks and Curley\u2019s wife?"

      "text": "1. Steinbeck opens *Of Mice and Men* with gorgeous imagery to describe the Salinas River Valley, the setting of the novella. Using the [*Valley Farms*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1803) painting as your inspiration, draw/sketch the setting of your hometown. On pages 1-2 of *Of Mice and Men*, Steinbeck paints with his words. Using similar imagery, write a descriptive paragraph to accompany your artwork.\r\n2. Reread the [excerpt from *The Novels of John Steinbeck*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1802). Moore claims *Of Mice and Men* does not qualify as a tragedy. Do you agree? Write an essay argument supporting your opinion."
