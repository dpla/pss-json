Some musicians claim that rock combated prejudice and advanced civil rights. Discuss the reasons for such claims, using the [radio program about \u201cTutti Frutti\u201d](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/591) and the videos of [Chuck Berry](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/590) and [Dorothy LaBostrie](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/592).\r\n2. Look up the lyrics to \u201cMemphis,\u201d the song Chuck Berry performs in the [video](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/590). Now view the [photograph of the anti-Beatles group](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/594) and the [concert poster](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/597), listen to the [radio program about \u201cTutti Frutti,\u201d](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/591)  and read [Dave Marsh\u2019s discussion](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/595) of the FBI investigation of the Kingsmen\u2019s \u201cLouie Louie.\u201d Explain why some perceived rock \u2019n\u2019 roll as a threat and protested against it. Discuss the similarities between the controversy over rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and contemporary controversies in popular culture, such as violence in video games or objectification of women in hip hop.\r\n3. Some thought rock \u2019n\u2019 roll would be a trend that would not last\u2014music for teens and tweens. Using three of the primary sources in this set, explain rock \u2019n\u2019 roll\u2019s endurance, including why it might appeal to all kinds of listeners."

Henry\u2019s 1967 [poster](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/597) demonstrates the important relationship between rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and design, from concert posters to album art.
