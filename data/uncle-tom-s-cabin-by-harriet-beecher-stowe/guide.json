      "text": "1. Read Chapter XII of *Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin*, which addresses the sale of slaves. Identify the characters who argue for or against slavery, and list the different arguments these characters make. Now look at the [illustration of the slave auction](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/330). Connect the image with one of the character\u2019s arguments for or against slavery. How could the character use the image to support the argument?\r\n\r\n2. *Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin* is best known for creating controversy and sparking opinions and emotions on an important issue of its time. Discuss how \"[The Scourged Back](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/332)\" may have contributed to controversy over slavery and abolition. What other literary works have created controversies or addressed social issues? \r\n\r\n3. A review of the novel in the *Southern Literary Messenger* argues that Harriet Beecher Stowe \u201cintermeddle[s] with things which concern her not\u201d and as a result, has \u201cforfeited the claim to be considered a lady.\u201d What could be the things in which Stowe is accused of meddling? Brainstorm reasons why this meddlesome behavior might cause her to be considered unladylike in 1852. Discuss what it means to be a lady today, and how this compares with the era of Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin. Finally, compare the *Southern Literary Messenger* review with the [review from *Fraser\u2019s Magazine*](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/338).\r\n\r\n4. Discuss adaptations of *Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin*. Look at the illustrations of [Topsy and Eva](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/333) and [Tom and Legree](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/334), the [announcement of the stage adaptation](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/339), the [minstrel show](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/340), and the [World War II political cartoon](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/341). Identify ways that the story, the characters, and the telling changed over time. Compare the adaptations of and changes to *Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin* to a more recent text that has been adapted for the stage or screen.\r\n"
