      "text": "1. Compare the images in the [sketches from *Sue\u00f1o y mentira de Franco*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1860). Describe any differences you see in the images made before the Guernica bombing and those Picasso drew after (the sketches on the bottom row and in the middle square on the left). Compare the [sketches from *Sue\u00f1o y mentira de Franco*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1860) with the finished painting [*Guernica*](http://www.museoreinasofia.es/sites/default/files/obras/DE00050_0.jpg) as well. How might changes in Picasso\u2019s drawing style and imagery suggest his own changing impressions of the war?\r\n2. Compare ways the artists use airplanes as symbols in the [poster honoring the Republican Air Force](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1870) and the [poster featuring a mother and child](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1871). In what ways do both posters function as propaganda for their particular side in the Spanish Civil War?\r\n3. Read the preface in the [excerpt from a catalog for a Surrealist art exhibition](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1861). In what ways do you see surrealist concepts demonstrated in Picasso\u2019s artworks, such as [*Guernica*](http://www.museoreinasofia.es/sites/default/files/obras/DE00050_0.jpg), [sketches from *Sue\u00f1o y mentira de Franco*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1860), and [*The Charnel House*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1872)? How do these artworks compare to other images in the catalog?\r\n4. Compare the [photograph of destroyed buildings in Guernica](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1862), the [photograph of German soldiers](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1863), the [propaganda poster after the bombing of Barcelona](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1864), and the [photograph of Spanish war refugees](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1866). How are people represented? Are they recognizable or meant to remain anonymous? Why do you think the photographer chose to depict them in this way? How do they help to communicate the photographer\u2019s message? \r\n5. Read the [excerpt from a US propaganda pamphlet](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1868) and the [excerpt from a letter written by a Catholic group](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1869). What issues seem most important to the authors? What words and phrases do they use that suggests their ideological bias? Find specific passages that support your response.\r\n6. Compare the [excerpt from a US propaganda pamphlet](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1868) and the [excerpt from a letter written by a Catholic group](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1869) to the narration in the [excerpt from the film *Why We Fight*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1865). How do the speakers/authors use language and tone to persuade their audience?\r\n7. Compare the [Spanish child\u2019s drawing](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1867) to Picasso\u2019s imagery in [*Guernica*](http://www.museoreinasofia.es/sites/default/files/obras/DE00050_0.jpg), the [sketches from *Sue\u00f1o y mentira de Franco*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1860), and the war photographs in this set. Which details of the child\u2019s drawing are similar to these other images? How does knowing the artist was a child affect your response to the image? \r\n"

      "text": "1. Ask students to research incidents where Picasso\u2019s [*Guernica*](http://www.museoreinasofia.es/sites/default/files/obras/DE00050_0.jpg) has been in the news and share findings in a presentation to the class. Follow up with a class discussion or individual reflection papers exploring how the particular circumstances of each incident affected how people interpreted the painting\u2019s meaning or cultural significance.  Some incidents students might investigate include: 1) Where was the painting kept for the thirty-six years of Francisco Franco\u2019s dictatorship in Spain? When was it first viewed in Spain? Where is it now? 2) What controversy arose around [*Guernica*](http://www.museoreinasofia.es/sites/default/files/obras/DE00050_0.jpg) in 2003 when Colin Powell spoke to the United Nations Security Council about the US war with Iraq? 3) Why was [*Guernica*](http://www.museoreinasofia.es/sites/default/files/obras/DE00050_0.jpg) vandalized in 1974? What issues are raised by the destruction or attempts to destroy works of art? \r\n4) Where are some of the places [*Guernica*](http://www.museoreinasofia.es/sites/default/files/obras/DE00050_0.jpg) has been reproduced? How might the painting\u2019s meaning change when it is seen in different contexts?\r\n2. Have students look for recent photographs that depict refugees of the war and civil violence in Syria, South Sudan, or Myanmar and share them with the class. Ask students to compare these contemporary images to the [photograph of destroyed buildings in Guernica](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1862), the [photograph of German soldiers](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1863), the [propaganda poster after the bombing of Barcelona](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1864), and the [photograph of Spanish war refugees](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1866) and identify visual similarities. Have students develop concept maps linking visual details to different words, emotions, ideas, or other meaning they might communicate to the viewer. End with a discussion whether [*Guernica*](http://www.museoreinasofia.es/sites/default/files/obras/DE00050_0.jpg)\u2019s themes of pain, sorrow, loss, and fear still seem relevant to the experience of war today.\r\n3. Have students work alone or with a partner to make a propaganda poster. Lead a discussion about social, political, or environmental issues and have them choose a topic for their poster. In a class discussion, identify key features and characteristics of the posters in this set: the [propaganda poster after the bombing of Barcelona](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1864), the [poster honoring the Republican Air Force](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1870), and the [poster featuring a mother and child](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1871). Encourage students to consider other items in this set that shaped public opinion and brainstorm how they could use similar strategies in their own posters. Before they begin work on their posters, have students research their topic, looking for images or visual symbols that will enhance or illustrate key points, and choosing short phrases and words to communicate their message in a clear and persuasive way.
