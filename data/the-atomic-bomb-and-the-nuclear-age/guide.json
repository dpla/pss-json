Using the [photograph of the first atomic bomb](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/50), the [eyewitness account of the Trinity bomb test](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/51), and the [film showing the destruction of the atomic bomb](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/55), describe the scale of destruction caused by the detonation of the atomic bomb. \r\n\r\n2. What is the main message of the [1955 civil defense film](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/56)? What strategies do the filmmakers use to appeal to children? \r\n\r\n3. Using the evidence in the [photograph of members of Non-Violent Action Against Nuclear Weapons](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/57), the [1953 cartoon of a hydrogen bomb](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/61), and the [1950 cartoon of Death](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/62), what were some of the arguments against the atomic bomb and nuclear armament?\r\n\r\n4. Why was the [Limited Test Ban Treaty](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/60) important? What national interests for the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union would it have protected?\r\n\r\n5. Using the items in this set, what connections can you draw between the development of the atomic bomb during the nuclear age and present-day nuclear talks?"
