What are the pro-German arguments laid out in the [excerpt from the *Times*](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1084) and the [excerpt from Bartlett\u2019s book](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1085)? How does this reflect the divided loyalties in the United States at the outbreak of World War I in Europe?\r\n3. With outside information on Germany\u2019s invasion of Belgium and the reported atrocities there, use the two posters that make reference to Belgium to describe the US\u2019s relationship with Belgium.\r\n4. How do the [poster about France](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1088) and the [poster about food waste](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1089) show attitudes in the United States shifting away from neutrality?\r\n5. How does the warning in the [*Lusitania* text](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1090) and the [1917 enlistment poster](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1091) display the drama and tragedy of the sinking of the *Lusitania*?\r\n6. The [poster about German \u201ctraps,\u201d](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1092) the [poster about defeating the Kaiser](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1093), and the [poster about defeating U-Boats](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1093) all demonstrate increasing tensions between the US and the German Empire. Create a list of events and tactics that pushed the US closer to war. \r\n7. Use the [photograph of President Wilson\u2019s speech](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1096) and the [text of President Wilson\u2019s speech](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1096) to explain the diplomatic steps that brought the US to declare war. What reasons did Woodrow Wilson outline?"

Students will find additional propaganda pieces on the Digital Public Library of America site. Ask them to sort the pieces using categories created by the class (different purposes, emotions, kinds of imagery, e.g.). Identify and discuss positive and negative strategies for conveying these messages. Students can use their findings to create their own propaganda poster and present it to the class. This could be done in groups or individually. "
