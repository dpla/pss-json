Study the [portrait of Queen Victoria](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1851) and the [dedication and poem from *Victoria Regia*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1856). What did Victoria look like? How did her subjects and admirers describe her? What characteristics or traits were associated with Victoria, her reign, and the Empire she commanded? \r\n2. Compare the images of Victorian buildings or interiors found in this source set: the [photograph of Wisconsin home interior](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1845), the \u201c[Making a Scrap Book](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1847)\u201d print, the [African American family record chart](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1848), the [photograph of Victoria Terminus](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1854), and the excerpt from \u201c[New Crystal Palace Polka](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1858).\u201d Which distinguishing characteristics of Victorian design or ornamentation can you identify from them? How might \u201cVictorian\u201d style differ from architecture and design in other eras? (Compare, for example, with Georgian or Classical Revival architecture, or the Arts and Crafts, Art Deco, or Modernist movements.)\r\n3. Observe the [advertisement for Dr. Scott\u2019s Electric Corset](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1858). What attractions and benefits does \u201cDr. Scott\u201d claim for his product? To whom might this advertisement appeal? What could you conclude from this ad about Victorian clothing, marketing techniques, medical advances, or manufacturing? \r\n4. Drawing upon the [excerpt from *The Lady\u2019s Guide to Gentility*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1849), the [African American family record chart](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1848), the \u201c[Don\u2019t Say Nay](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1850)\u201d print, and the [photo of the cricket team](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1857), explain what defined the appearance of a proper Victorian man or woman, and list some of the etiquette rules that guided their social behavior. \r\n5. Victorian social codes governed not only romantic relationships but also friendships. What can the [calling card case](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1846) and the [excerpt from *The Lady\u2019s Guide to Gentility*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1849) reveal about how people developed and maintained friendships in Victorian times? \r\n6. How did Victorians express grief and respond to the death of a loved one? Describe the mourning rituals that are evident in the [portrait of Queen Victoria](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1851), the [crafted wreath](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1852), and the [photograph of Samuel Charles Stowe](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1853). In what ways are these rituals similar to and different from ones we see today? "

Have students read aloud and discuss the \u201cbreak-up letters\u201d included in the [excerpt from *The Lady\u2019s Guide to Perfect Gentility*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1849). To what contemporary situations might the letters be compared? Have small groups of students write a letter to address a hypothetical present-day relationship issue using Victorian-style manners and language. Make up a few current examples and have students pick at random. For example: \"You just found out that your boyfriend has been liking the Instagram photos of his ex. Write a break-up letter in the Victorian style.\"\r\n2. \u201cVictorian\u201d values, morals, and aesthetics had a long reach\u2014extending throughout the global British Empire with structures of colonial power, cultural texts, and material objects. Invite students to generate a researched list or concept map of Victorian values, cultural assumptions, beliefs, or social/political movements. Align items from this source set with the list or place them onto the concept map to show connections between objects/texts and the cultural values they represent. "
