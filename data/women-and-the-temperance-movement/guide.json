Describe how the [illustration from *Temperance Torchlights*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1775), \u201c[Intemperance and Cholera](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1780),\u201d the cartoon \u201c[A Model School Among the Germans](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1781),\u201d and the [article from the *Los Angeles Voice*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1787) portray the dangers of drinking. What arguments do these sources make for temperance or abstinence, and what evidence do they provide for support?\r\n2. Other than refraining from drinking alcohol, what values did the Temperance Movement support? Choose three primary sources and use them to identify these values. \r\n3. Use [Lyman Beecher\u2019s sermon](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1774), [Dio Lewis\u2019s biography](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1776), the [illustration of the temperance meeting](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1779), and [Frances Willard\u2019s address](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1783) to compare men\u2019s and women\u2019s roles in promoting temperance.\r\n4. Look at the [illustration from *Sweet Cicely*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1778) and the [advertisement for the Keeley Institute](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1788). Analyze how they portray women promoting temperance. Next, compare the image and the ad with how the [photograph of Carrie Nation](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1785) portrays the well-known temperance crusader.\r\n5. Many believed that it was women\u2019s Christian duty to crusade for temperance. Use the appeal women crusaders presented to liquor sellers of Fredonia in [Dio Lewis\u2019s biography](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1776) to explain how they combined faith with femininity.\r\n6. Consider that many women who participated in the Temperance Movement also were involved with other social causes. Use [Frances Willard\u2019s address](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1783) and \u201c[Temperance Arithmetic](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1782)\u201d to identify the movements and interests that overlapped with the Temperance Movement and its supporters.

Ask students to use the following primary sources to identify the different strategies women used to advocate for temperance: the [illustration from *Sweet Cicely*](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1778), [Dio Lewis\u2019s biography](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1776), [Frances Willard\u2019s address](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1783), and the photograph of [Carrie Nation\u2019s \u201chatchetation\u201d of the saloon in Kansas](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1786). Next, divide students into groups. Each team will argue for the temperance strategy they find most effective, drawing on evidence from the primary sources above.\r\n2. Ask students to research black women\u2019s involvement in the Temperance Movement and Ida B. Wells. Next, they should research the Willard/Wells dispute described in [Frances Willard\u2019s letter to Albion Tourg\u00e9e](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1784), then hypothesize about the opportunities and obstacles black women faced in campaigning for temperance and other causes. After looking again at Frances Willard\u2019s letter, each student should write a letter from Ida B. Wells to Frances Willard that responds to the statement that Willard has been characterized unfairly \u201cas the enemy of a race that I love and on whose behalf I would do anything.\u201d"
