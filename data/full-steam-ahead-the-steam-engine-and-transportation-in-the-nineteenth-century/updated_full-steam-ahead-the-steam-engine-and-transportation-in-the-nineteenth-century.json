         "text": "Isaac Briggs was an engineer and surveyor and William Longstreet was an inventor. They used their steam engine to power a steamboat along the Savannah River in 1807, but Robert Fulton had successfully piloted his steamboat, the *Clermont*, in New York several days earlier. This patent, issued by the State of Georgia, was granted before the formation of the U.S. Patent Office. \r\n\r\nTranscript:\r\n\r\nAn Account Of The Construction And Principles Of Briggs' And Longstreet's Steam Engine, For The Exclusive Use Of Which A Privilege Was Granted To The Investors, For Fourteen Years, By An Act Of The Legislature Passed At Augusta, The First Day Of February, 1788.\r\n\r\nThis engine consists of a Boiler, two Cylinders and a Condenser, constructed in the following manner, viz.:\r\n\r\nThe Boiler<br>\r\nConsists of two metallic vessels, globular, or nearly so, placed one within the other, so as to leave a small interstice between, in which interstice the boiling water is contained. The inner vessel contains the fuel, the flame of which passes through a spiral flue winding round the outside of the outer vessel from the bottom to the top. The steam is conveyed by a pipe from the boiler into an interstice between\r\n\r\nThe Two Cylinders<br>\r\nWhich are placed, horizontally, one within the other, from whence it is admitted alternately into each end of the inner cylinder, in which it impels a piston to vibrate both ways with equal force. It is also admitted alternately to pass from each end of the inner cylinder (all the communications, to and from which, are opened and shut by a single cock) by means of pipes into\r\n\r\nThe Condenser,<br>\r\nWhich is a metallic vessel having a large surface in contact with cold water. The condensed steam or warm water is drawn out of it by a pump.\r\n\r\nI. Briggs,<br>\r\nWm. Longstreet. <br>\r\nRecorded 30th Jan. 1789.\r\n",

The first steam engines were invented in the early 1700s in England and improved during the mid-eighteenth century. By the late 1780s, European inventors were experimenting with steam-powered boats and American engineers followed suit. Following Robert Fulton\u2019s successful demonstration of his steamboat, the *Clermont*, on the Hudson River in 1807, steamboats quickly became one of the most popular means of trade and travel in America. Steamboat routes emerged along major rivers, across the Great Lakes, in the Caribbean, and on transatlantic routes between the US and Europe. In the 1840s and 1850s, steamboats also helped facilitate settlement on the West Coast, including California and Oregon.\r\n\r\nThe steam engine also transformed the railroad industry. Steam locomotives and railroad systems were created in England, but by 1830, inventor and industrialist Peter Cooper had designed the first American-built steam locomotive, called the Tom Thumb. Together, steamboats and steam-powered trains offered unprecedented speed and efficiency for travel, trade, and communication between distant parts of the country and world. The steam engine played crucial roles in the Industrial Revolution and westward expansion. "
