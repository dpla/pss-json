Using the [excerpt from *Homesteading*](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/133) by Edward West, describe how women\u2019s roles on homesteads differed from the traditional roles of women in established towns or cities.\r\n\r\n2. Why were railroads interested in advertising homesteading opportunities through pamphlets like the pamphlets included here?\r\n\r\n3. Look at the [photo of a social gathering](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/126), as well as the two maps. What are some difficulties that homesteaders faced in forming communities or socializing? Why might forming a community be important when living on the prairie? \r\n\r\n4. What details does the [photo of the \u2018homestead family\u2019](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/129) illustrate about homesteading life?\r\n\r\n5. Using the images, maps, and text descriptions in this set, cite specific examples of challenges homesteaders faced. Why would these men and women decide to go west? Was it worth it? Use specific evidence to prove the worthiness/unworthiness of the migration.\r\n"
