Compare the \u201cAbout Tonight\u2019s Play\u201d excerpts. What parallels do you see in the storylines and role of women in *Kiss Me Kate* and *Gypsy*?\r\n3. Look at the photograph and recording of *My Fair Lady*, a \u201crags to riches\u201d story that has been revived several times on Broadway. Why do you think this is the case? What is it about this story that continues to captivate audiences even today?\r\n4. Describe the value of a revival. In looking at the photographs and items specifically from revival performances, identify what seems to make a show worthy of reviving. Do you think that social conditions in the 1970s, for instance, mirrored those of the 1940s and 50s?"
