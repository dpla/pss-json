What strategies did they use to overcome these challenges? How did other people treat them as they migrated?\r\n\r\n2. Several of the photographs in this set are by the famous Farm Security Administration photographer Dorothea Lange, who documented the struggles of the Dust Bowl migrants. Lange\u2019s work was also an inspiration for John Steinbeck. Using Lange\u2019s photographs and her [oral history](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/273) in this set, compare and contrast Lange\u2019s and Steinbeck\u2019s portrayals of the migrant experience.\r\n\r\n3. Using the [response pamphlet](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/272), consider the impact that the publication and popularity of *The Grapes of Wrath* had on the public image of California. Which particular aspects of the novel does this brochure challenge?\r\n\r\n4. The handbill is an important symbol in the novel. Using the [handbill advertising jobs for cotton pickers](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/263) and the [Santa Fe Railroad advertisement](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/264) as evidence, explain how the symbolic value of the handbill changes as the Joads get closer to California.\r\n\r\n5. How did Art King\u2019s experience of work, discrimination, and border crossing, described in his [interview](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/267), compare with the Joads\u2019? Which similar obstacles did they face?"
