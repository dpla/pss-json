Translator: Audrey Whitebloom.\r\n\r\nJM: Jose Marquez (father)  \r\nLM: Luis Marquez (son)\r\n\r\nInterviewer: I understand that Mr. Jose also started working as a manual laborer.\r\n\r\nJM: Yes.  \r\n\r\nLM:  Dad, do you remember when you used to tell us that you used to work as a bracero and illegally? Do you remember telling us about it?  \r\n\r\nJM: When I was illegal I was in Texas. I was in ranch that was called the 90, because it was very big...\r\n\r\nLM: And what year was that? Do you remember?  \r\n\r\nJM: No, I don't remember. \r\n\r\nLM: It was before we were born, remember?  \r\n\r\nJM: Yes, all of you were born after I was already there.\r\n\r\nLM: So it was around 1956 or 57 in those years when you were an illegal worker and after being an illegal worker you got a contract in a bracero program.  \r\n\r\nJM: Yes, I got a contract to come to work in California.\r\n\r\nLM: Do you remember what that job was? \r\n\r\nJM: They used to make a list then they would take you, not everyone, one here and there, to the center of contracts in  Guadalajara and they...\r\n\r\nLM:  The commissario would make the list, he would look for the candidates, he would look for the people...\r\n\r\nJM: Yes, but he wouldn't  include everyone...\r\n\r\nLM:  No, not everyone, only certain people...\r\n\r\nJM: Once they made the list they would take them to Guadalajara and they would do the contracts there.  \r\n\r\nLM: How would they send you there when they contracted you...in cars, in airplanes, in donkeys...in trains\u2026?\r\n\r\nJM: In trains.\r\n\r\nLM: Ah, in trains. So you went from Balded Sonora to the United States\u2026\r\n\r\nJM: Yes and from there they would give you the passports.  \r\n\r\nLM: Who would decide where u were going to work?  Who would decide that\u2026?\r\n\r\nJM: In Parma and Sonora, a lot of them would go to different places...and some would be sent to Arizona and I imagine they wanted to go because it was very hot over here...\r\n\r\nLM: So the bosses would arrive, looking for manual laborers, and braceros from Mexico would arrive.  So, would they say, I have some work Texas or I have work in California or I have work in Arizona... \r\n\r\nJM: It depended, some wanted twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty people.  \r\n\r\nLM: So was it voluntary, and you could say, I want to go to California, or I want to go to Texas?\r\n\r\nJM: Many wanted to go to Arizona because it is very hot there and that was what they were used to.\r\n\r\nLM: What did you used to do in San Jose? \r\n\r\nJM: Picked cucumbers and zucchini.  \r\n\r\nLM:  And how did they used to pay you, by hour or by contract? \r\n\r\nJM: Per hour.\r\n\r\nLM: Do you remember how much they used to pay you?\r\n\r\nJM: I used to get paid $1.25 an hour.\r\n\r\nLM: And why did you decide to come here, because mom brought you here or what?\r\n\r\nJM: Once the contract was over in Sonoma, then we came here.",
