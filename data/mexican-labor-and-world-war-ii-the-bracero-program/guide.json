Discuss how the reaction to the Bracero Program, as seen in the [letter to the Dallas newspaper](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/75), the [denied request](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/76), and the [transcribed Los Angeles Times story](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/77), mirrors present-day labor debates. How does it relate to the current Mexican border crisis?\r\n\r\n2. Look over the the [government report](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/72), the [Marquez oral history](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/73), the [Gradias oral history](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/74), the [letter to the Dallas newspaper](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/75), the [denied request](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/76), and the [transcribed Los Angeles Times story](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/77). What do these resources show are the major issues in debates about the Bracero Program? Who are some of the key players in these debates and what are their positions?\r\n\r\n3. Look at the seven photographs by Floyd Halleck Haskins in this set. What do these photos say about work and living conditions for braceros? What is the photographer\u2019s point of view on the program?\r\n\r\n4. Use the items in this set as evidence to explain the kinds of discrimination braceros faced in the United States. How did this discrimination impact their everyday lives?\r\n"
