      "text": "1. Analyze the activities for women during wartime portrayed in [Winslow Homer\u2019s engraving](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/813). Describe the roles women play here. Who is shown playing these roles? Compare the women in the image to the real women in this set, such as [Clara Barton](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/814), [Susie King Taylor](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/820), and [Nancy Kile Green](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/825). Now compare ideas about women\u2019s roles during the Civil War to ideas about women in war during the twenty-first century.\r\n2. Read [Josephine Crump\u2019s \u201cTwo Brave Women\u201d](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/817) and the excerpt from [Alcott\u2019s *Hospital Sketches*](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/815). Describe the hardships and sacrifices they portray. Discuss the similarities and differences between these eyewitness accounts. Evaluate the impact of the author\u2019s loyalties, Confederate (Crump) and Union (Alcott).\r\n3. Use [Josiah Benton\u2019s speech](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/827) to identify the obstacles that hindered women\u2019s involvement in the war effort. How does the speech support Clara Barton\u2019s statement that the war helped advance women\u2019s status?\r\n4. Use the sources on Susie King Taylor, the [\u201cContraband of War\u201d illustration](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/822), and [Harriet Tubman\u2019s affidavit](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/826) to describe some of the roles black women played during the Civil War. Compare these to the portrayal of a black female character in a film set around the time of the Civil War and Reconstruction.\r\n"

      "text": "1. Divide students into groups. One group will compare the two images of vivandi\u00e8res: the engraving of Kady Brownell and the postcard. The other will compare the [drawing of Loreta Velasquez](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/818) with the [illustration of Belle Boyd](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/819). How do these images contrast the ideal with the actual?\r\n2. Collectively research Harriet Tubman\u2019s role in the Combahee River raid in 1863. Ask students to use this information to develop arguments supporting or denying Tubman\u2019s claim to a military pension.\r\n"
