What does the word \u201cuppity\u201d mean? What does it suggest in the context of the ERA? How were supporters of the ERA changing the connotation of the word \u201cuppity\u201d?\r\n3. Consider the [cartoon by Tom Engelhardt](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1202), the [cartoon by Kate Salley Palmer satirizing shifting gender roles](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1204), and the [cartoon by Kate Salley Palmer satirizing opponents of the Equal Rights Amendment](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1209). Who were the audiences for these cartoons? How does each cartoon comment on the ERA? What makes the political cartoon an effective medium for this commentary?\r\n4. Use [Martha Griffiths\u2019s petition](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1200), the [Michigan Women\u2019s Commission pamphlet](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1203), and the [statement by Representative Barbara Jordan](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1206) to describe the ratification process and its obstacles for ERA supporters.\r\n5. Consider the [photograph of supporters and opponents](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1207), the [footage of an Equal Rights Amendment rally](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1208), the [photograph of Tom Bradley](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1210), and the [clip of Phyllis Schlafly](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1211). What do these sources suggest about who actively supported the ERA and who actively opposed it? \r\n6. Closely read the [statement by the US Commission on Civil Rights](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1205). For what historical reasons does this report support the passage of the ERA?\r\n"

Review the information in the [statement by the US Commission on Civil Rights](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1205) and ask students to do research to update its findings with contemporary information and statistics about marriage and divorce laws, women\u2019s pay and sex-based discrimination in the workforce, specific protection for women in criminal law, and women\u2019s equality in education. With this new research, ask students to draft individual letters to their Congressional representative outlining their findings and making a case for the ERA\u2019s contemporary relevance or irrelevance. If students favor a new, updated version of the ERA, encourage them to propose broad changes in the letter."
