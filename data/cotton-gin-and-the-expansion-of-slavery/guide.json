      "text": "1. Examine the [photograph of a cotton plant](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1873), [Eli Whitney\u2019s cotton gin model](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1874), the [stereo card of an African American worker](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1886), and the [*Harper\u2019s Weekly* illustration](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1887). How does the cotton gin work? What goes in and what comes out? What are the goals of using the gin?\r\n2. What does the [contract between Eli Whitney and the State of Tennessee](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1875) promise? Under what circumstances would it be null and void? What does this suggest about Whitney\u2019s experience as the inventor of the cotton gin?\r\n3. In the [petition by Eli Whitney to Congress](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1876), how does Whitney characterize his reasons for inventing a cotton gin? What is his argument for the renewal of his patent? Why is this renewal important for Whitney? Would you award him a renewal? Cite textual evidence from the petition to support your answers.\r\n4. Use information from the [1898 book about cotton](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1877) to describe the overall process of cotton harvesting. What role did the cotton gin play?\r\n5. What does the [advertisement from the Albany Cotton Gin Manufacturing Company](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1878) tell us about how the cotton industry grew between 1793 and 1868? Who is the audience for this advertisement? Cite evidence to support your answer.\r\n6. Use the [map of US cotton production in 1880](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1879) and the [map of the agricultural regions of the United States](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1880) to describe changes to the cotton industry between 1820 and 1924. In what specific areas was cotton being produced? How did the geography of cotton change over time? How did the overall industry change in terms of rate of production and profit? (Bonus: What does the bottom chart on the [map of US cotton production in 1880](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1879) say about the impact of the Civil War?)\r\n7. Compare the maps of [US cotton production in 1880](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1879), [agricultural regions of the United States](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1880), and the [distribution of the population of enslaved people](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1881). What do they reveal about the relationship between cotton production and slavery, especially in the mid-1800s?\r\n8. What does the [broadside advertising a slave auction](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1882) tell us about how the cotton industry had changed slavery\u2019s practices and economy by 1860?\r\n9. Examine the [broadside advertising a slave auction](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1882), the [illustration of enslaved persons laboring on a cotton plantation](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1883), the [photograph of African American women and children](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1884), the [stereo card depicting African American women and children](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1885), the [stereo card of an African American worker](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1886), and the [*Harper\u2019s Weekly* illustration](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1887). What do they indicate about the roles enslaved people and later free African Americans played in the cotton industry? How did an enslaved person\u2019s gender and age determine the type of labor he or she did? What were some the physical challenges of this labor?\r\n10. What do the [stereo card of an African American worker](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1886) and the [*Harper\u2019s Weekly* illustration](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1887) reveal about how antebellum African American laborers operated the cotton gin? What did the process look like and what labor was required?"

      "text": "1. *Research extension:* Ask students to use the maps of [US cotton production in 1880](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1879), [agricultural regions of the United States](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1880), and the [distribution of the population of enslaved people](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1881) to identify areas where slavery and cotton production were particularly concentrated by the 1860s. Areas could include coastal South Carolina, the Alabama Black Belt, the Mississippi River Valley, and coastal Texas. Once students have made a list of areas of concentration, divide them into small groups and assign each group one area. Ask each group to research the history of cotton production, slavery, and the cotton gin in that area, create a map of the area, build a timeline of major milestones, and present their findings to the class.\r\n2. *Research extension:* Eli Whitney created an early model for the cotton gin but many future inventors improved on it with the addition of features like steam power. Ask students to individually find a diagram of a post-1860 cotton gin model and present a comparison with [Eli Whitney\u2019s cotton gin model](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1874) by annotating the images with at least five comparisons or contrasts.\r\n3. *Historical connections:* Some historians have argued that Eli Whitney\u2019s invention of the cotton gin was a significant cause of the Civil War. Ask students to write a position paper that takes a stand on this claim, using additional research or prior knowledge of the causes of the Civil War."
