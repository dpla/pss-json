After reading the [1916 Congressional bill](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/913), the [1920 article by John Muir](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/916), the [1916 annual report of the Secretary of the Interior](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/917), and the [1893 petition](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/918), define the movement for the \u201cpreservation\u201d of natural resources. What did the authors of these sources propose to do?\r\n2. After reading the [1908 essay by Gifford Pinchot](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/919), the [speech by Theodore Roosevelt in 1905](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/920), and the [text calling for forest preservation in Alabama](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/921), define the movement for the \u201cconservation\u201d of natural resources. What did the authors of these sources hope to achieve? How did their views differ from the authors of the sources used in the previous question?\r\n3. Drawing upon the [1939 film](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/914), the photo of the [Sapphire Pool](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/915), the photograph of [John Muir and Theodore Roosevelt](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/922), and the photograph of a [tunnel](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/923), discuss why people visit national parks. What experiences are they hoping to have? What does \u201cnature\u201d mean to them and what does it include? \r\n"
