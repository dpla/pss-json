Look at the [image of the defense lawyer Arthur Garfield Hays reading scientists\u2019 testimony](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/239) into the record near a \u201cRead Your Bible\u201d sign. Who do you think may have hung those signs and why? What might be an impact of those signs\u2019 presence during the trial? \r\n\r\n3. In the [record of witness testimony](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/238), why do you think Clarence Darrow, the defense lawyer, asks this student if he still attends church?\r\n\r\n4. Look at the [\u201cNew Exhibit in the Hall of Fame\u201d political cartoon](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/246). What is the relationship between these animals? What is the cartoon\u2019s commentary on the Scopes Trial?\r\n"
