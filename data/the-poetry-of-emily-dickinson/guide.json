      "text": "1. Henry Wells claims that Dickinson \u201ctranscended both her genius and her sex, her provincial world and her personal relationships\u201d (xiii). Think about the poet\u2019s isolation and consider the relationship between imagination and freedom. Use [Wells\u2019 overview](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/836) of Emily Dickinson\u2019s poetry, the [map of Amherst](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/833), and Dickinson\u2019s poems to explore how limitations and boundaries may encourage creativity. Now discuss why you agree or disagree with Wells\u2019 statement that Dickinson\u2019s poetry transcends the boundaries of physical isolation.\r\n2. Few of Emily Dickinson\u2019s poems were published in her lifetime. When she died she left her possessions, including more than 800 poems, to her sister Lavinia. Look at the [letter Dickinson wrote to Lavinia](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/834). In it she writes, \u201cDoes Vinnie think of Sister? Sweet news. Thank Vinnie. Emily may not be as able as she was, but all she can, she will.\u201d Analyze Dickinson\u2019s use of third person for herself and her sister. Why does she call herself \u201cEmily\u201d instead of \u201cI\u201d and use the nickname \u201cVinnie\u201d instead of \u201cyou\u201d? Hypothesize a connection between the letter\u2019s use of third person and the themes of Dickinson\u2019s poems, such as separateness, loss, and transcendence.\r\n3. Look at the [letter Dickinson wrote to T.W. Higginson](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/835). It begins, \u201cDear Friend, no \u2018sonnet\u2019 had George Eliot. The sweet acclamation of Death is forever bounded.\u201d Research Higginson, George Eliot, and sonnets. Next, discuss their potential connections to the four Dickinson poems in this set."

      "text": "1. Use the [page from the 1857 issue of Godey\u2019s Lady's Book](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/837) to identify what the magazine calls \u201cthe wants of the ladies of America\u201d at that time. Divide students into groups and give each group a recent issue of a contemporary magazine for women, such as *Family Circle*, *O: The Oprah Magazine*, or *Real Simple*. Each group will compare female magazine readers\u2019 interests in the 1850s to those today. Finally, assign each group of students a poem by Emily Dickinson, who turned 27 the year this issue of *Godey\u2019s* was published. Discuss the similarities and differences between the poem\u2019s interests and the interests *Godey\u2019s* identifies.\r\n2. After studying the form and content of Emily Dickinson\u2019s poetry, ask students to list its distinct features, such as dashes, free verse, and themes of loss and freedom. Challenge students to write a poem in Dickinson\u2019s style. Compile the poems in a booklet, as Dickinson did. Small groups might discuss which poems are their favorites or evaluate which best match Dickinson\u2019s style."
