Compare and contrast the ways Sacagawea is portrayed on the [coin](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/153) and in the [sculpture](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/159). What does each say about her legacy?\r\n\r\n2. Using the items in this set as evidence, describe the challenges that the Lewis and Clark faced. How did they prepare for and overcome these challenges?\r\n\r\n3. Look at the [list of presents](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/150) Lewis purchased for Native Americans he would meet in his travels. Select one of the gifts and speculate about how a Native American recipient might have reacted to this gift and put it to use.\r\n\r\n4. Look at the [1945 map](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/152) of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. What does this illustration of their journey reveal about their travels?"
