Consider the [photograph of Sojourner Truth](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/172) and the [text of Frederick Douglass\u2019 speech](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/171). Why were the voices of former slaves essential to the success of the abolitionist movement?\r\n\r\n2. How were visual images, including objects such as the [British medallion](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/173), and the popular press used to advance the abolitionist cause?\r\n\r\n3. Using the [excerpt from the 1838 printed pamphlet](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/170), explain how women fighting for suffrage found common cause with abolitionists. \r\n\r\n4. Using [*Abolitionism Exposed!*](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/175) as evidence, describe some counterarguments to abolition that were expressed at the time.\r\n\r\n5. What was one argument made for the eradication of slavery by abolitionists? Choose one item from this set that expresses that argument. \r\n"

A cousin from South Carolina writes to you to ask about [*The Liberator*](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/179), about which she has heard many rumors. Write a letter to her in which you tell her what you know about *The Liberator* and what you have read in the latest issue. Include your opinions on *The Liberator*, its abolitionist cause, and its tactics.\r\n\r\n2. Ask students to choose five documents from the gallery above, and to create their own document-based question about abolitionism. Ask students to share their document-based questions with a partner and to discuss how they would respond to the question, using evidence to justify their response."
