      "text": "1. Based on the explanation of the \u201cOpen Skies\u201d policy in the [speech by Senator Lodge](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1703), if the Soviet Union had adopted more transparency, how might the Space Race, or the Cold War itself, have changed?\r\n2. What impact did the launch of Sputnik have in the United States, as reflected in the \u201c[Another Race We Can Lose](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1704)\u201d cartoon? How do you think Americans felt about a second Soviet satellite launch so quickly after Sputnik I and the inclusion of a dog based on the [trading card featuring Laika](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1705)?\r\n3. Using the account by the American official in the [1958 news clip](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1706), how did the early Soviet success impact the United States and push its space program?\r\n4. How did Space Race espionage efforts benefit from satellite technology, like the [Explorer I](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1707) and the Corona program described in the [paper about the missile gap between the US and USSR](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1708)? What role did espionage, or spying, have in the Space Race? \r\n5. Given the reflection by the Air Force general in the [1960 news clip](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1709), what connection did the Space Race have to the nuclear arms race? What do you think the general meant when he said that rocket technology could be used to propel \u201cthings\u201d into orbit?\r\n6. Based on the [1961 political cartoon featuring Yuri Gagarin](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1710) and the [excerpt from President Kennedy\u2019s speech](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1711), what role did the success of Yuri Gagarin\u2019s flight have in influencing American policy? Based on the [excerpt from President Kennedy\u2019s speech](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1711) about urgent national needs, what was the United States prepared to spend? Where did they intend to go? What reasons does Kennedy give for investment in the space program?\r\n7. Compare and contrast the [1962 news clip of the Centaur explosion](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1712) with the [1969 footage of the Apollo 11 lunar landing](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1713). How did previous setbacks make the moon landing possible? Describe the activities and tasks of the astronauts once on the moon. What stands out to you about the moon footage?\r\n8. Given the Soviet Union\u2019s early successes in the Space Race, what do the [model of the Soviet N-1 rocket](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1714) and the [chart of Soviet space program costs](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1715) tell you about the costs of the Space Race for the Soviet Union? Based on your prior knowledge or outside research, what else was taking place politically, economically, and socially in the Soviet Union during the 1970s and 1980s?\r\n9. How might the Strategic Defense Initiative described in the [1988 news clip](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1716) demonstrate a shift from prior motivations behind the Cold War Space Race?\r\n10. How does the [diagram of the International Space Station](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1717) demonstrate a post-Cold War world? In what ways does the International Space Station represent a change in space research compared to the 1950s?"

Students might look for political cartoons, propaganda posters, and other sources that represent both American and Soviet perspectives on the Space Race. Students will analyze their selected sources in the context of the Cold War and present their findings to the class in the format of their choice, which might include a slide presentation, a gallery walk, a written argument, etc. "
