Using the [land grant map](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1173), the [letter to Stephen Austin](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1171), and the [Galveston Land Company deed](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1172), what can you infer about the reasons that Americans sought out a colony in Mexico? What kinds of American settlers do you think would be attracted to the opportunity to move to a new colony outside the United States?\r\n2. Compare the [announcement](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1174) about supporting Texians in revolution and [*The War in Texas*](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1175). How does each source frame the motivations of the Texian settlers?\r\n3. In the [letter to the Mexican people](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1176), how did the Texians perceive Mexico\u2019s centralist government? What do they define as their cause, or the purpose for their revolution? How do they see themselves in relation to Native Americans? Why do you think they invited \u201cpatriotic Mexicans\u201d to join them in the revolution?\r\n4. Using the [Constitution of the Republic of Texas](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1181), the [letter to the Mexican people](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1176), and the [recruitment announcement](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/1174), explain some ways in which the Texas Revolution reflected central questions of American history.\r\n"

Using the primary sources provided, assign one half of the class to argue for and the other half against the following statement: *The American colonists who moved to Texas settled with the intention of eventually forming their own political entity.* Students assigned to each argument should work together to identify evidence from the primary sources to support their claim, craft convincing arguments, and anticipate counterarguments from the other team. In the debate, invite each side to make an opening statement of no more than two minutes, to be followed by a round of rebuttals. Following the debate, lead a class discussion evaluating the implications of each team\u2019s historical argument. How did the ideology and beliefs of the settlers influence the Revolution? Why did the Mexican government allow so many Americans to move in, settle, and acquire huge swaths of land? What were the main events contributing to the outbreak of Revolution? \r\n"
