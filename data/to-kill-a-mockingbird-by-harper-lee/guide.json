Compare and contrast the photographs of [kids and a new car](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/656) and the [sharecropper family in Macon County](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/657). How do these two pictures relate to the Finch children and the Cunninghams? How do they relate to the Great Depression? Use textual evidence to support your answer.\r\n\r\n2. Listen to the [interview](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/659) with Rosa Jackson. Explain how Atticus Finch would have reacted to Rosa\u2019s arrest. How is Atticus similar to Judge Abernathy? How is Tom Robinson similar to Rosa Jackson? Use textual evidence to support your answer.\r\n\r\n3. Look at the [photograph of the children on the playground](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/655). Find a quotation from the book that could caption this picture. How does this image show Scout\u2019s feelings about Jem\u2019s school experience? What emotion does the picture evoke?\r\n\r\n4. Look over the [review of Alabama schools](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/654), specifically in rural areas. Reread chapter two about Scout\u2019s first day of school. What do we learn about rural schools in Alabama during the Great Depression from a historical document and a fictionalized account? Use textual evidence from the novel to support your answer.\r\n\r\n5. Scout tells the reader in chapter one that \u201cthere was no hurry, for there was nowhere to go, nothing to buy and no money to buy it with...But it was a time of vague optimism for some people: Maycomb County had recently been told that it had nothing to fear but fear itself.\" This historical allusion is from Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s [first inaugural address](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/645). Read the first page of the address. How could this speech help revive a nation in the depths of a Great Depression? "

Emulating the tone of the excerpt, have students write a one-paragraph editorial proclaiming Tom Robinson\u2019s innocence. Finally, show the [\u201cScottsboro Limited\u201d pamphlet](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/650), the [flyer](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/651), the [photograph of mothers](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/652), and the [photograph of the Communist parade](http://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sources/653). Allow students to discuss. Students should describe the items, explain what is happening in each, explain how each makes them feel, and identify how each is connected to *To Kill a Mockingbird*."
